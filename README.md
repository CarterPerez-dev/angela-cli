# Angela-CLI
1.  **I want an AI partner so deeply woven into my shell that its presence feels almost ambient, yet instantly responsive.** It's more than just a keyword trigger; I want the boundary between my standard shell commands and my instructions to "Angela" to blur. When I type `Angela refactor the main loop in processor.py for clarity`, I want the shell's response mechanism itself to feel like it *understands* this isn't a literal command named "Angela" but an invocation of this embedded intelligence. The transition should be frictionless, immediate, and devoid of the clunkiness of launching a separate process or waiting for a distinct interface. It should feel less like I'm *running a tool* and more like the shell itself has gained a natural language understanding layer.
2.  **I want Angela's contextual awareness to be profound and dynamic.** Defining a project root is just the start. I want her to potentially infer the *type* of project (Is this a Node.js app? A Python library? A Hugo static site?) and leverage that knowledge. If I say `Angela add a dependency for 'requests'`, she should know to use `pip install requests` and update `requirements.txt` in a Python project, or `npm install requests` and update `package.json` in a Node project and more
3.  **I want to express complex, multi-step intentions, not just simple tasks.** My goal isn't just mapping single sentences to single commands. I want to be able to articulate workflows: `Angela, create a new feature branch named 'user-auth', switch to it, create a 'auth.py' file in the 'services' directory with a basic Flask blueprint structure, and then stage that new file.` Angela should be able to decompose this complex request into the necessary sequence of `git checkout -b`, `cd`, `touch`, code generation, and `git add` commands, presenting the entire plan for my approval. I want her to handle conditional logic implicitly
4.  **I want Angela's versatility to extend across my entire development ecosystem.** She shouldn't just be limited to file operations and code generation. I want her to be my natural language interface to other CLI tools I use daily:
    *   **Version Control:** `Angela, show me the differences in the last commit`, `Angela, revert the changes to 'config.yaml'`, `Angela, squash the last 3 commits into one`.
    *   **Containers:** `Angela, restart the 'webserver' docker container`, `Angela, show me the logs for the database container`.
    *   **Cloud Services:** `Angela, list my S3 buckets`, `Angela, deploy the latest changes to the staging environment` (invoking the necessary `gcloud`, `aws`, or `az` commands).
    *   **Databases:** (With appropriate configuration/safety) `Angela, show me the schema for the 'users' table`.
    She should become the universal translator for the myriad of CLI tools I interact with.

Ultimately, **I'm aiming for nothing less than a paradigm shift in command-line interaction.** I want to build an AI entity that lives within my terminal, understands my projects and my natural language goals deeply, and translates those goals into actions across my entire digital workspace. It's about creating an environment where the power of the command line is accessible through intuitive conversation, making me fundamentally more effective, creative, and less encumbered by technical minutiae. It's about building the command-line partner I've always wished I had. Imagine only a very very advanced genius programmer could create such a project

# *********WHAT I WANT TO ACHEIVE (BRIEF OVERVIEW) - IT WILL BE SOEM OF THIS BUT EVEN MORE AND AT AN EVEN HIGHER LEVEL, WERE ESSENRTIALLY RECREATING TEH MOST INTELLEGENT AND CAPABLE OPERATING SYSTEM, TERMINAL, SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, DEVOPS ENGINEER, AI AGENT, AND MORE< WERE CREATING AGI BUT IN A TERMINAL. TEH WORLDS FIRST AGI WILL BE CREATED BY ME AND WILL LIVE IN A TERMINAL*****
**Phase 8: Seamless Shell Integration & Enhanced Interaction**
*   **Goal:** Make Angela feel like an intrinsic part of the shell, blurring the lines between standard commands and AI interactions. Improve the core user experience for invoking and interacting with Angela.
*   **Key Objectives:**
    *   **Advanced Shell Hooking:** Investigate and implement deeper shell integration beyond simple aliases. Explore options like:
        *   Zsh/Bash plugins for more sophisticated input interception or pre-command hooks.
        *   Potential integration with terminal multiplexers (like tmux or Zellij) if feasible.
        *   Using `PROMPT_COMMAND` (Bash) or `precmd`/`preexec` (Zsh) hooks for contextual awareness *before* a command is run or *after* it finishes.
    *   **Natural Invocation:** Design mechanisms where Angela can be invoked more naturally, perhaps even implicitly based on command patterns or specific keywords within a command line, rather than always requiring the `angela` prefix. (e.g., detecting `git commit -m "refactor login logic based on ticket #123"` and offering AI assistance).
    *   **Inline Feedback & Interaction:** Enhance `shell/formatter.py` to allow Angela to provide feedback or ask clarifying questions *inline* within the terminal session, potentially modifying the current command line or presenting interactive prompts without breaking the user's flow entirely.
    *   **Contextual Auto-Completion:** Develop AI-powered auto-completion suggestions that leverage Angela's understanding of the project context, recent files, and user intent.

**Phase 9: Deep Contextual Understanding & Semantic Awareness**

*   **Goal:** Elevate Angela's understanding from file paths and types to the *semantic meaning* of code, project state, and complex user intentions.
*   **Key Objectives:**
    *   **Code Semantic Analysis:** Integrate more advanced static analysis tools (like tree-sitter or language servers) or leverage the LLM's code understanding capabilities more deeply to parse functions, classes, dependencies within code files.
    *   **Project State Inference:** Move beyond basic type detection. Infer the *state* of the project (e.g., current Git branch status, pending migrations, test coverage status, build health).
    *   **Fine-Grained Activity Tracking:** Enhance `context/file_activity.py` to track not just file access, but potentially specific function/class modifications (might require IDE integration or file watching with parsing).
    *   **Advanced Intent Decomposition:** Improve `intent/enhanced_task_planner.py` to handle more ambiguous, multi-stage goals. Develop strategies for the LLM to ask clarifying questions when decomposition is uncertain.
    *   **Contextual Prompting V2:** Refine `ai/prompts.py` to feed semantic code information, detailed project state, and nuanced user history to the LLM for significantly more informed responses.

**Phase 10: Expanded Ecosystem Integration (Core Developer Tools)**

*   **Goal:** Enable Angela to understand and interact with a wider range of essential developer tools beyond basic Git and package managers.
*   **Key Objectives:**
    *   **Docker Integration:** Implement understanding and execution of common Docker commands (`build`, `run`, `ps`, `logs`, `stop`, `rm`). Allow requests like "Angela, show me the logs for the webserver container" or "Rebuild the backend Docker image". Requires specific command generation logic and potentially parsing Docker output.
    *   **Cloud CLI Integration (Select Platforms):** Target one or two major cloud providers (e.g., AWS CLI, gcloud CLI). Implement understanding for common resource listing, status checks, and simple deployment commands (e.g., "List my S3 buckets", "What's the status of my EC2 instances?", "Deploy the app to App Engine"). This involves careful command generation and potentially parsing structured output (JSON/YAML).
    *   **Database Interaction (Basic & Safe):** Configure safe, read-only interaction with common databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL). Allow requests like "Show the schema for the 'users' table" or "Count the number of records in the 'orders' table". Requires secure credential management and query generation/validation.
    *   **Toolchain Module Enhancement:** Refactor and expand `angela/toolchain/` to include dedicated modules for Docker, Cloud CLIs, and Databases, abstracting the interaction logic.

**Phase 11: Autonomous Multi-File Code Generation & Refinement**

*   **Goal:** Enable Angela to generate and modify entire multi-file codebases based on high-level descriptions, including interactive refinement.
*   **Key Objectives:**
    *   **Multi-File Planning:** Enhance `generation/planner.py` and `generation/architecture.py` to plan complex directory structures and inter-file dependencies for larger projects (e.g., full web applications).
    *   **Coherent Code Generation:** Improve `generation/engine.py` to generate consistent code across multiple files, ensuring imports, function calls, and data structures align. This likely involves iterative generation and passing context between file generation steps.
    *   **Massive Context Handling:** Implement strategies (e.g., RAG with code context, summarization, iterative prompting) to manage the large context required for generating substantial codebases with the LLM.
    *   **Interactive Refinement Loop:** Integrate `review/feedback.py` and `review/diff_manager.py` more deeply. After generation, present a summary/diff to the user and allow natural language feedback (e.g., "Change the database model to include an email field", "Use functional components instead of class components in React") to trigger regeneration/modification cycles.
    *   **Framework Specialization:** Enhance `generation/frameworks.py` to support generating more complete and idiomatic code for the specific frameworks detected in Phase 9/10.

**Phase 12: Advanced Orchestration & Universal Tool Translation**

*   **Goal:** Achieve near-AGI capability within the terminal by enabling complex task orchestration across *any* CLI tool and automating full CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Key Objectives:**
    *   **Universal CLI Translator:** Develop a robust mechanism (likely LLM-driven with sophisticated prompting and validation) to translate natural language requests into commands for *arbitrary* CLI tools, leveraging `--help` output, man pages, or general knowledge. This requires strong safety validation (`safety/validator.py`).
    *   **Complex Workflow Orchestration:** Enhance the `Orchestrator` and `EnhancedTaskPlanner` to handle workflows involving sequences of commands across different tools (e.g., Git -> Docker -> Cloud CLI -> kubectl).
    *   **Automated CI/CD Pipeline Execution:** Integrate `toolchain/ci_cd.py` fully. Allow requests like "Set up a full CI/CD pipeline for this Node.js project on GitHub Actions, including build, test, lint, and deploy to staging". This involves generating complex configuration *and* potentially triggering initial pipeline runs or setup commands.
    *   **Self-Correction & Learning:** Implement mechanisms for Angela to learn from failed commands or workflows, potentially attempting self-correction or refining its understanding of specific tools based on error messages and successful outcomes.
    *   **Proactive Assistance V2:** Enhance `monitoring/background.py` to offer more complex suggestions based on combined context (e.g., "Your tests failed after the last commit, want me to try reverting and rerunning?", "Your cloud deployment seems to be unhealthy, want me to check the logs?").

These 5 phases provide a structured approach to tackling the remaining challenges, moving from foundational UX improvements and deeper understanding towards complex actions and broad tool integration, culminating in the advanced orchestration required for the AGI-like vision.



This will establish the core infrastructure before integrating AI capabilities, ensuring a solid foundation for the more complex features to follow, to ocomplish IT WILL BE SOEM OF THIS BUT EVEN MORE AND AT AN EVEN HIGHER LEVEL, WERE ESSENRTIALLY RECREATING TEH MOST INTELLEGENT AND CAPABLE OPERATING SYSTEM, TERMINAL, SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, DEVOPS ENGINEER, AI AGENT, AND MORE< WERE CREATING AGI BUT IN A TERMINAL.
