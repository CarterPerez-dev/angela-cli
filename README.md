**Project Title:** **Angela-CLI** 

**Core Concept:**

Angela Acts as an intelligent copilot for terminal operations and imprtaly Code generation autonomously adn at a very very high level, it should be able to create entire webistes an even run them, enhancing productivity, reducing errors, and lowering the barrier to entry for complex tasks and very very high level large scale code generation and deployment.

**Benefits:**

*   **Increased Productivity:** Faster execution of complex or unfamiliar tasks.
*   **Reduced Cognitive Load:** No need to memorize obscure command syntax.
*   **Lower Barrier to Entry:** Makes powerful shell capabilities accessible to less experienced users.
*   **Learning Tool:** Users can see the actual commands generated by the AI, helping them learn.
*   **Automation of Tedious Tasks:** Simplifies repetitive file management or setup processes.
*   **MASSIVE CODE GENERATION AUTOMATICALLY ADN AUTONMOUSLY EVEN WITH CI/CD AUTOMATICALLY ADN AUTOTOMOUSLY WITH MASSIVE CONTEXT STORAGE**
*   **THE AI AGENT IS INTERTWINED AND ESSENTIALLY LIVES IN THE SHELL AS TEH HIGH INTELLEGENT BRAIN AND CONDUCTOR OF THE SHELL/TERMINAL**

**Challenges:**
*   **Accuracy:** Ensuring the AI correctly interprets intent and generates the correct. commands/code.
*   **Context Management:** Effectively tracking the relevant state (directory, environment variables, previous actions) at a very large and high level.
*   **Ambiguity Resolution:** Handling unclear or underspecified user requests gracefully while maintaining focusing on a seamless user experience.
*   **Performance:** Latency of AI model responses impacting the interactive feel.
*   **Integration Complexity:** Modifying or wrapping shells reliably can be tricky.

This in-depth description outlines a powerful tool that blends natural language processing with core system operations, potentially transforming how users interact with their command-line environment.

## Tech stack:
Python, Ubuntu Linux

1.  **I want an AI partner so deeply woven into my shell that its presence feels almost ambient, yet instantly responsive.** It's more than just a keyword trigger; I want the boundary between my standard shell commands and my instructions to "Angela" to blur. When I type `Angela refactor the main loop in processor.py for clarity`, I want the shell's response mechanism itself to feel like it *understands* this isn't a literal command named "Angela" but an invocation of this embedded intelligence. The transition should be frictionless, immediate, and devoid of the clunkiness of launching a separate process or waiting for a distinct interface. It should feel less like I'm *running a tool* and more like the shell itself has gained a natural language understanding layer.

2.  **I want Angela's contextual awareness to be profound and dynamic.** Defining a project root is just the start. I want her to potentially infer the *type* of project (Is this a Node.js app? A Python library? A Hugo static site?) and leverage that knowledge. If I say `Angela add a dependency for 'requests'`, she should know to use `pip install requests` and update `requirements.txt` in a Python project, or `npm install requests` and update `package.json` in a Node project. Her "mental map" shouldn't just be static file paths; ideally, it incorporates an understanding of common project layouts, configuration file locations, and maybe even recent files I've worked on within that project, allowing for even more concise instructions like `Angela edit the file I was just working on`.

3.  **I want to express complex, multi-step intentions, not just simple tasks.** My goal isn't just mapping single sentences to single commands. I want to be able to articulate workflows: `Angela, create a new feature branch named 'user-auth', switch to it, create a 'auth.py' file in the 'services' directory with a basic Flask blueprint structure, and then stage that new file.` Angela should be able to decompose this complex request into the necessary sequence of `git checkout -b`, `cd`, `touch`, code generation, and `git add` commands, presenting the entire plan for my approval. I want her to handle conditional logic implicitly, like `Angela, find all images larger than 1MB in the assets folder and optimize them`, where she figures out the `find` command and then applies an appropriate optimization tool (like `optipng` or `jpegoptim`) to each result.

4.  **I want Angela's versatility to extend across my entire development ecosystem.** She shouldn't just be limited to file operations and code generation. I want her to be my natural language interface to other CLI tools I use daily:
    *   **Version Control:** `Angela, show me the differences in the last commit`, `Angela, revert the changes to 'config.yaml'`, `Angela, squash the last 3 commits into one`.
    *   **Containers:** `Angela, restart the 'webserver' docker container`, `Angela, show me the logs for the database container`.
    *   **Cloud Services:** `Angela, list my S3 buckets`, `Angela, deploy the latest changes to the staging environment` (invoking the necessary `gcloud`, `aws`, or `az` commands).
    *   **Databases:** (With appropriate configuration/safety) `Angela, show me the schema for the 'users' table`.
    She should become the universal translator for the myriad of CLI tools I interact with.

5.  **I want the reduction in cognitive load to foster a state of creative 'flow'.** The constant mental context-switching between my high-level goal and the low-level syntax required to achieve it breaks concentration and introduces friction. By offloading the syntactical burden to Angela, I want to stay focused on the *design*, the *logic*, the *problem-solving*. The terminal should transform from a potential source of frustration ("What was that flag again?") into a smooth conduit for my intentions. This isn't just about saving time; it's about changing my *relationship* with the command line from potentially adversarial to truly collaborative and empowering. I want it to feel less like giving orders and more like having a conversation with a highly competent assistant.

Ultimately, **I'm aiming for nothing less than a paradigm shift in command-line interaction.** I want to build an AI entity that lives within my terminal, understands my projects and my natural language goals deeply, and translates those goals into actions across my entire digital workspace. It's about creating an environment where the power of the command line is accessible through intuitive conversation, making me fundamentally more effective, creative, and less encumbered by technical minutiae. It's about building the command-line partner I've always wished I had. Imagine only a very very advanced genius programmer could create such a project

**Act as an expert Principal Software Architect.**

**Your Task:** You are tasked with designing the initial high-level technical strategy and architecture for a new project called **Angela-CLI**.

**Key Desired Characteristics (for the AI to consider):**

1.  **Seamless Integration:** Feels like part of the shell, not a separate clunky tool. Triggering Angela should be natural and immediate.
2.  **Natural Language Understanding:** Interprets user intent, not just keywords. Handles multi-step requests and workflows.
3.  **Contextual Awareness:** Understands the current directory, project structure (potentially inferred or user-defined), and maybe recent activity to resolve ambiguity.
4.  **Versatile Action Capabilities:** Translates intent into:
    *   Shell command generation & execution.
    *   File/directory creation, manipulation, and *content-aware editing*.
    *   Code snippet/boilerplate generation.
    *   Interfacing with common developer tools (Git, Docker, potentially cloud CLIs).
    *   **MASSIVE CODE GENERATION AUTOMATICALLY ADN AUTONMOUSLY EVEN WITH CI/CD AUTOMATICALLY ADN AUTOTOMOUSLY WITH MASSIVE CONTEXT STORAGE**
*   **THE AI AGENT IS INTERTWINED AND ESSENTIALLY LIVES IN THE SHELL AS TEH HIGH INTELLEGENT BRAIN AND CONDUCTOR OF THE SHELL/TERMINAL**

## Phases-- This is just a core struccture but will be expaned on 10x fold
## Brief Roadmap
## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Project Setup & Shell Hook
1. Initialize project structure with core directories
2. Implement basic configuration loading (API keys)
3. Create shell function in `angela.bash`/`angela.zsh`:
   ```bash
   # Basic shell hook
   angela() {
     python -m angela "$@"
   }
   ```
4. Implement CLI entry point with argument parsing
5. Create simple echo capability that passes request to Python backend

### Step 2: Orchestration & Context
1. Build orchestrator to manage request flow
2. Implement working directory tracking
3. Create project root detection via markers (.git, etc.)
4. Add basic logging and error handling
5. Design data models for requests/responses
6. Implement testing framework

### Step 3: Gemini API Integration
1. Create Gemini API client class
2. Design initial prompt templates with context injection
3. Implement response parsing and error handling
4. Build basic intent classification (command vs. file operation)
5. Add simple command suggestion capability (non-executing
### Step 4: Intelligent Interaction & Contextual Execution
(Focus: Make single commands/simple sequences smarter, faster, and provide richer feedback. Enhance immediate context use.)
Enhanced NLU & Tolerant Parsing: Implement more sophisticated Natural Language Understanding (ai/parser.py, intent/analyzer.py) to handle more complex or slightly misspelled/ambiguous single commands or simple sequences. Introduce interactive clarification (safety/confirmation.py using prompt_toolkit) but only when confidence is low (e.g., below ~70% match or high ambiguity); otherwise, attempt the most likely interpretation to maintain flow.
Rich Feedback & Asynchronous Streaming: Integrate rich and asyncio deeply (execution/engine.py, shell/formatter.py) for real-time, well-formatted feedback during command execution. Provide progress indicators (spinners/bars), stream stdout/stderr asynchronously, and give clear status updates, making Angela feel highly responsive. Capture all output cleanly.
Context-Aware Adaptive Confirmation: Leverage project type, recent activity, and command history (context/manager.py) to dynamically adjust confirmation needs (safety/classifier.py, orchestrator.py). Frequently used, low-risk commands in familiar contexts execute with minimal friction, while riskier operations still get detailed previews (safety/preview.py), balancing seamlessness with safety. Add detailed command history tracking (context/history.py).
Enhanced File/Directory Operations & Context: Implement more robust and complex file/directory operations (execution/filesystem.py) building on Phase 3 basics (e.g., recursive operations, pattern matching). Enhance context (context/filesystem.py) with reliable file type detection and basic metadata understanding to inform AI suggestions and operations.
### Step 5: Autonomous Task Orchestration & Proactive Assistance
(Focus: Enable high-level goal execution, deep content understanding, learning user workflows, and proactive behaviour.)
High-Level Goal Decomposition & Multi-Step Orchestration: Empower the AI (intent/planner.py, orchestrator.py) to break down complex user goals ("Deploy latest dev to staging") into sequences of commands/actions. Plan dependencies, visualize the execution flow (shell/formatter.py with rich), gain confirmation, and execute the orchestrated plan, monitoring progress and handling intermediate steps/errors gracefully.
Conversational Context & Session Memory: Implement robust session memory (context/manager.py, orchestrator.py) allowing Angela to understand follow-up commands referencing entities (files, outputs, errors) from the current interaction ("Try that again with sudo", "Analyze those errors").
AI-Powered File Content Comprehension & Manipulation: Integrate AI (ai/client.py, potentially new ai/content_analyzer.py) to understand the content of files (code functions, config values, text). Enable natural language requests for content-aware tasks like refactoring simple functions, updating configuration entries, or summarizing logs (execution/filesystem.py, safety/preview.py showing diffs). Create underlying utilities for safe content manipulation.
User-Defined Workflows via Natural Language: Allow users to teach Angela reusable multi-step workflows ("Define 'publish package' as: run tests, bump version, build, upload"). Angela (intent/planner.py, new workflows/manager.py) translates, confirms, saves, and allows invocation by the user-defined name.
Proactive Monitoring, Suggestions & Advanced Rollback: Implement optional background monitoring (orchestrator.py, asyncio) for contextual nudges (lint errors, git status, process crashes) via shell/formatter.py. Offer proactive suggestions/autofill based on deeper context (context/*, ai/*). Enhance rollback mechanisms (safety/*, execution/*) to specifically support undoing multi-step or content-manipulation actions where feasible, maintaining safety without hindering the autonomous capabilities.
### Step 6: Enhanced Project Context
1. Implement project type inference
2. Add dependency detection in projects
3. Create file reference resolution from natural language
4. Implement recent activity tracking
5. massivly Enhance prompt engineering with project context
### Step 7: Developer Tool Integration (MAIN ASPECTY OF THIS WHOLE THING WERE IT COMES ALL TOGETHOR)
1. Add Git commands integration
2. Implement Docker support
3. Create code generation flow. it should be able to create 8000 word code files, or small websites/apps etc etc. its essntially a code agent capapbale of great coding stregths. if teh user sasy "create me a porfolio website" it shoud be able to udnertand that and go ahead and create a whole directory/tree structure with files and even code those files in full and have it fully ready for developement.
# *********WHAT I WANT TO ACHEIVE (BRIEF OVERVIEW) - IT WILL BE SOEM OF THIS BUT EVEN MORE AND AT AN EVEN HIGHER LEVEL, WERE ESSENRTIALLY RECREATING TEH MOST INTELLEGENT AND CAPABLE OPERATING SYSTEM, TERMINAL, SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, DEVOPS ENGINEER, AI AGENT, AND MORE< WERE CREATING AGI BUT IN A TERMINAL. TEH WORLDS FIRST AGI WILL BE CREATED BY ME AND WILL LIVE IN A TERMINAL*****
**Phase 8: Seamless Shell Integration & Enhanced Interaction**

*   **Goal:** Make Angela feel like an intrinsic part of the shell, blurring the lines between standard commands and AI interactions. Improve the core user experience for invoking and interacting with Angela.
*   **Key Objectives:**
    *   **Advanced Shell Hooking:** Investigate and implement deeper shell integration beyond simple aliases. Explore options like:
        *   Zsh/Bash plugins for more sophisticated input interception or pre-command hooks.
        *   Potential integration with terminal multiplexers (like tmux or Zellij) if feasible.
        *   Using `PROMPT_COMMAND` (Bash) or `precmd`/`preexec` (Zsh) hooks for contextual awareness *before* a command is run or *after* it finishes.
    *   **Natural Invocation:** Design mechanisms where Angela can be invoked more naturally, perhaps even implicitly based on command patterns or specific keywords within a command line, rather than always requiring the `angela` prefix. (e.g., detecting `git commit -m "refactor login logic based on ticket #123"` and offering AI assistance).
    *   **Inline Feedback & Interaction:** Enhance `shell/formatter.py` to allow Angela to provide feedback or ask clarifying questions *inline* within the terminal session, potentially modifying the current command line or presenting interactive prompts without breaking the user's flow entirely.
    *   **Contextual Auto-Completion:** Develop AI-powered auto-completion suggestions that leverage Angela's understanding of the project context, recent files, and user intent.

**Phase 9: Deep Contextual Understanding & Semantic Awareness**

*   **Goal:** Elevate Angela's understanding from file paths and types to the *semantic meaning* of code, project state, and complex user intentions.
*   **Key Objectives:**
    *   **Code Semantic Analysis:** Integrate more advanced static analysis tools (like tree-sitter or language servers) or leverage the LLM's code understanding capabilities more deeply to parse functions, classes, dependencies within code files.
    *   **Project State Inference:** Move beyond basic type detection. Infer the *state* of the project (e.g., current Git branch status, pending migrations, test coverage status, build health).
    *   **Fine-Grained Activity Tracking:** Enhance `context/file_activity.py` to track not just file access, but potentially specific function/class modifications (might require IDE integration or file watching with parsing).
    *   **Advanced Intent Decomposition:** Improve `intent/enhanced_task_planner.py` to handle more ambiguous, multi-stage goals. Develop strategies for the LLM to ask clarifying questions when decomposition is uncertain.
    *   **Contextual Prompting V2:** Refine `ai/prompts.py` to feed semantic code information, detailed project state, and nuanced user history to the LLM for significantly more informed responses.

**Phase 10: Expanded Ecosystem Integration (Core Developer Tools)**

*   **Goal:** Enable Angela to understand and interact with a wider range of essential developer tools beyond basic Git and package managers.
*   **Key Objectives:**
    *   **Docker Integration:** Implement understanding and execution of common Docker commands (`build`, `run`, `ps`, `logs`, `stop`, `rm`). Allow requests like "Angela, show me the logs for the webserver container" or "Rebuild the backend Docker image". Requires specific command generation logic and potentially parsing Docker output.
    *   **Cloud CLI Integration (Select Platforms):** Target one or two major cloud providers (e.g., AWS CLI, gcloud CLI). Implement understanding for common resource listing, status checks, and simple deployment commands (e.g., "List my S3 buckets", "What's the status of my EC2 instances?", "Deploy the app to App Engine"). This involves careful command generation and potentially parsing structured output (JSON/YAML).
    *   **Database Interaction (Basic & Safe):** Configure safe, read-only interaction with common databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL). Allow requests like "Show the schema for the 'users' table" or "Count the number of records in the 'orders' table". Requires secure credential management and query generation/validation.
    *   **Toolchain Module Enhancement:** Refactor and expand `angela/toolchain/` to include dedicated modules for Docker, Cloud CLIs, and Databases, abstracting the interaction logic.

**Phase 11: Autonomous Multi-File Code Generation & Refinement**

*   **Goal:** Enable Angela to generate and modify entire multi-file codebases based on high-level descriptions, including interactive refinement.
*   **Key Objectives:**
    *   **Multi-File Planning:** Enhance `generation/planner.py` and `generation/architecture.py` to plan complex directory structures and inter-file dependencies for larger projects (e.g., full web applications).
    *   **Coherent Code Generation:** Improve `generation/engine.py` to generate consistent code across multiple files, ensuring imports, function calls, and data structures align. This likely involves iterative generation and passing context between file generation steps.
    *   **Massive Context Handling:** Implement strategies (e.g., RAG with code context, summarization, iterative prompting) to manage the large context required for generating substantial codebases with the LLM.
    *   **Interactive Refinement Loop:** Integrate `review/feedback.py` and `review/diff_manager.py` more deeply. After generation, present a summary/diff to the user and allow natural language feedback (e.g., "Change the database model to include an email field", "Use functional components instead of class components in React") to trigger regeneration/modification cycles.
    *   **Framework Specialization:** Enhance `generation/frameworks.py` to support generating more complete and idiomatic code for the specific frameworks detected in Phase 9/10.

**Phase 12: Advanced Orchestration & Universal Tool Translation**

*   **Goal:** Achieve near-AGI capability within the terminal by enabling complex task orchestration across *any* CLI tool and automating full CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Key Objectives:**
    *   **Universal CLI Translator:** Develop a robust mechanism (likely LLM-driven with sophisticated prompting and validation) to translate natural language requests into commands for *arbitrary* CLI tools, leveraging `--help` output, man pages, or general knowledge. This requires strong safety validation (`safety/validator.py`).
    *   **Complex Workflow Orchestration:** Enhance the `Orchestrator` and `EnhancedTaskPlanner` to handle workflows involving sequences of commands across different tools (e.g., Git -> Docker -> Cloud CLI -> kubectl).
    *   **Automated CI/CD Pipeline Execution:** Integrate `toolchain/ci_cd.py` fully. Allow requests like "Set up a full CI/CD pipeline for this Node.js project on GitHub Actions, including build, test, lint, and deploy to staging". This involves generating complex configuration *and* potentially triggering initial pipeline runs or setup commands.
    *   **Self-Correction & Learning:** Implement mechanisms for Angela to learn from failed commands or workflows, potentially attempting self-correction or refining its understanding of specific tools based on error messages and successful outcomes.
    *   **Proactive Assistance V2:** Enhance `monitoring/background.py` to offer more complex suggestions based on combined context (e.g., "Your tests failed after the last commit, want me to try reverting and rerunning?", "Your cloud deployment seems to be unhealthy, want me to check the logs?").

These 5 phases provide a structured approach to tackling the remaining challenges, moving from foundational UX improvements and deeper understanding towards complex actions and broad tool integration, culminating in the advanced orchestration required for the AGI-like vision.



This will establish the core infrastructure before integrating AI capabilities, ensuring a solid foundation for the more complex features to follow, to ocomplish IT WILL BE SOEM OF THIS BUT EVEN MORE AND AT AN EVEN HIGHER LEVEL, WERE ESSENRTIALLY RECREATING TEH MOST INTELLEGENT AND CAPABLE OPERATING SYSTEM, TERMINAL, SOFTWARE DEVELOPER, DEVOPS ENGINEER, AI AGENT, AND MORE< WERE CREATING AGI BUT IN A TERMINAL.
