# Angela-CLI: Strategic Technical Blueprint

## Conceptual Architecture

Below is the high-level architecture for Angela-CLI, designed to create a seamless, context-aware AI shell assistant that prioritizes both user experience and safety.

### Core Components

1. **Shell Integration Layer**
   - Hooks into Bash/Zsh to intercept "Angela" requests
   - Provides immediate feedback to maintain interactive feel
   - Manages command history and terminal state

2. **Orchestration Service**
   - Controls the overall request lifecycle
   - Routes information between components
   - Maintains session state during multi-step interactions

3. **Context Manager**
   - Tracks working directory and project root
   - Builds project structure understanding
   - Resolves relative references in natural language

4. **AI Interaction Service**
   - Prepares context-enriched prompts for Gemini API
   - Handles API communication and error management
   - Processes and structures AI responses

5. **Intent Parser & Action Planner**
   - Converts natural language to structured intent
   - Decomposes complex requests into atomic actions
   - Generates execution plans (commands, file operations)

6. **Safety & Confirmation Module**
   - Classifies actions by risk level
   - Presents planned actions clearly to users
   - Manages confirmation workflow

7. **Execution Engine**
   - Safely executes confirmed actions
   - Captures command output and errors
   - Provides real-time feedback during execution

8. **Configuration Manager**
   - Stores API credentials and preferences
   - Manages project-specific settings
   - Handles initialization and updates

### Data Flow Diagram

```
User Request ("Angela...") → Shell Integration Layer →
    Orchestration Service → Context Manager (enriches request) →
    AI Interaction Service (Gemini API) → Intent Parser →
    Action Planner → Safety Module (confirmation) →
    Execution Engine → Shell Output
```

## High-Level Phased Roadmap

### Phase 1: Shell Integration & Echo (Foundation)
**Goal:** Establish the basic input/output loop with minimal functionality.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Shell hook mechanism to capture "Angela" requests
- Basic command-line argument processing
- Configuration structure for API credentials
- Simple request-echo capability to verify pipeline
- Initial context awareness (current directory tracking)

**Success Criteria:** User can type "Angela hello" and receive a confirmation that the request was received through the entire pipeline.

### Phase 2: AI Understanding & Read-Only Operations
**Goal:** Integrate AI capabilities with safe, non-destructive operations.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Gemini API integration with prompt engineering
- Basic intent parsing for information retrieval
- Support for read-only shell commands (find, grep, ls, etc.)
- Simple command execution with output capture
- Enhanced context with basic project structure detection

**Success Criteria:** Angela can understand and execute queries like "Angela find all Python files in this project" with appropriate shell commands.

### Phase 3: Safety Framework & Command Expansion
**Goal:** Establish robust safety controls while expanding command capabilities.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive safety classification system
- Clear confirmation interface with action preview
- Support for basic file system operations (mkdir, touch)
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Multi-step action planning for sequential operations

**Success Criteria:** Angela can plan file operations with clear confirmation steps and execute them safely upon approval.

### Phase 4: Enhanced Context & Developer Workflows
**Goal:** Improve context understanding and support for development tools.

**Key Deliverables:**
- Project type inference (Python, Node.js, etc.)
- Integration with common developer tools (Git, Docker)
- Basic code generation capabilities
- Support for more complex multi-step workflows
- Improved natural language understanding for ambiguous requests

**Success Criteria:** Angela can handle contextual requests like "Angela create a feature branch for user authentication, set up the basic files, and stage them."

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Shell Integration Approach:**
   - Consider using shell functions and aliases for tight integration
   - Explore PROMPT_COMMAND (Bash) or precmd (Zsh) hooks for seamless experience
   - Maintain asynchronous operation to prevent shell blocking

2. **Context Management Strategy:**
   - Use marker files (.git, package.json, etc.) for project type detection
   - Consider caching project structure for performance
   - Support explicit root definition via configuration file

3. **Safety Prioritization:**
   - Implement progressive permission model (read-only first, then file creation, then modification)
   - Use clear visual differentiation for dangerous operations
   - Provide "dry run" capabilities for complex workflows

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Implement local caching of context information
   - Consider request queueing for non-blocking operation
   - Design for graceful degradation during API outages

This blueprint provides a strategic foundation for Angela-CLI that emphasizes safety, user experience, and incremental development. Each phase builds on the previous one, delivering increasing value while maintaining a focus on the core vision of a natural, contextually-aware command-line AI assistant.
