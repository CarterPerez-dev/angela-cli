117. **`angela/utils/async_utils.py`**
    Provides utility functions (`run_async`, `to_sync`, `run_async_background`) for managing asynchronous operations from synchronous contexts. This helps integrate `asyncio` code into parts of the application that might not be fully async.

118. **`angela/utils/logging.py`**
    **(Note: This is distinct from `angela/components/utils/logging.py`. It seems to be a higher-level re-export or an older version. The primary logging setup is in `components/utils/logging.py`.)**
    Likely re-exports logging utilities from `angela.components.utils.logging` for convenience at the `angela.utils` namespace level.

**Missing Files (Not Python files within `angela/` or already covered as non-Python scripts):**
All shell scripts like `angela.bash`, `angela.tmux`, `angela_enhanced.bash`, `angela_enhanced.zsh` are not Python files and thus not included in this Python file explanation list.

I've focused on the Python modules within the `angela` directory tree you provided. The non-Python scripts in `angela/components/shell/` have also been omitted from this Python file explanation list as requested.
