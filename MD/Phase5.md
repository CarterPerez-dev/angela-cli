# Phase 5: Autonomous Task Orchestration & Proactive Assistance

## Overview
Phase 5 represents a significant advancement in Angela's capabilities, transforming it from a command translator to a true AI agent that can autonomously accomplish complex tasks. This phase implements:

1. **High-Level Goal Decomposition**: Breaking down complex user goals into sequences of commands
2. **Deep Content Understanding**: AI-powered file analysis and manipulation capabilities
3. **User-Defined Workflows**: Ability to define, save, and execute reusable workflows
4. **Proactive Assistance**: Background monitoring for potential issues

## Key Components Implemented

### Intent Planning System (`intent/planner.py`)
- Task planner for breaking down complex goals into discrete steps
- Dependency management for determining execution order
- Risk assessment for each step in a plan

### Content Analysis System (`ai/content_analyzer.py`)
- File content understanding with language-specific analysis
- Content searching with natural language queries
- Content manipulation with automatic diff generation

### Workflow Management (`workflows/manager.py`)
- Creating, storing, and executing user-defined workflows
- Variable substitution for dynamic workflows
- Tagging and categorization of workflows

### Background Monitoring (`monitoring/background.py`)
- Git status monitoring for uncommitted changes
- File change monitoring for syntax errors
- System resource monitoring

### Enhanced Visualization (`shell/formatter.py`)
- Rich interactive visualization of multi-step plans
- Dependency graph visualization
- Better formatting for execution results

## Command Line Improvements
- New `--monitor` flag for background monitoring
- New `workflows` command for managing workflows:
  - `workflow list` - List available workflows
  - `workflow create` - Create a new workflow
  - `workflow run` - Execute a workflow
  - `workflow delete` - Delete a workflow
  - `workflow show` - Show workflow details

## Usage Examples

### Multi-Step Task Execution
```
angela "Create a Python project with a virtual environment, install Flask and pytest, and initialize a Git repository"
```

### Content Analysis & Manipulation
```
angela "Analyze the code in main.py and suggest improvements"
angela "Find all functions in utils.py that handle file operations"
angela "Refactor the process_data function in data_handler.py to use list comprehensions"
```

### Workflow Definition & Execution
```
angela workflows create deployment "Deploy to production server"
angela workflows run deployment --var ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### Background Monitoring
```
angela --monitor
```

## Future Enhancements for Phase 5.5
1. Expand the content analysis capabilities to more file types and languages
2. Improve workflow sharing and importing
3. Add more background monitoring capabilities (network, dependency updates)
4. Implement more sophisticated AI planning for complex goals
5. Improve error recovery during multi-step task execution

### Step 6: Enhanced Project Context
1. Implement project type inference
2. Add dependency detection in projects
3. Create file reference resolution from natural language
4. Implement recent activity tracking
5. massivly Enhance prompt engineering with project context

## Key Technical Achievements
1. **Robust Task Planning**: Created a sophisticated planning system that can break down complex goals into executable steps
2. **AI-Powered Content Understanding**: Implemented deep file analysis and manipulation capabilities
3. **Context-Aware Workflows**: Built a flexible workflow system that can adapt to different environments
4. **Proactive Monitoring**: Created a non-intrusive background monitoring system
5. **Enhanced Visualization**: Improved the terminal UI for better user experience

With Phase 5 complete, Angela now offers true autonomous capabilities, allowing users to express high-level goals in natural language and have them automatically translated into executable actions.
