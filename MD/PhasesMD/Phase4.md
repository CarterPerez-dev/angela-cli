This implementation focuses on the key priorities for Phase 4:

Default to Execution: Modified request function to default execute=True
Streamlined Confirmation: Created an adaptive confirmation UI that reduces friction for safe operations
Context-Aware Safety: Implemented a trust system that adapts based on command history and patterns
Progressive Trust: Built a system that learns from user behavior and reduces confirmation requirements
User Preferences: Implemented a persistent preferences system for customization
Task Continuity: Added session context to maintain state between requests

# We must now work on Phase 4 part 2 (continued)
Next Steps
continue with phase 4
### Step 4: Intelligent Interaction & Contextual Execution --- continue on this and complete things we haven't done yet regarding phase 4 and build upon phase 4 part 1 implementations at a high level
Update the CLI interface to reflect these changes
Implement error analysis visualization in the terminal UI
Enhance the prompting system to better leverage conversational context
(Focus: Make single commands/simple sequences smarter, faster, and provide richer feedback. Enhance immediate context use.)
Enhanced NLU & Tolerant Parsing: Implement more sophisticated Natural Language Understanding (ai/parser.py, intent/analyzer.py) to handle more complex or slightly misspelled/ambiguous single commands or simple sequences. Introduce interactive clarification (safety/confirmation.py using prompt_toolkit) but only when confidence is low (e.g., below ~70% match or high ambiguity); otherwise, attempt the most likely interpretation to maintain flow.
Rich Feedback & Asynchronous Streaming: Integrate rich and asyncio deeply (execution/engine.py, shell/formatter.py) for real-time, well-formatted feedback during command execution. Provide progress indicators (spinners/bars), stream stdout/stderr asynchronously, and give clear status updates, making Angela feel highly responsive. Capture all output cleanly.
Context-Aware Adaptive Confirmation: Leverage project type, recent activity, and command history (context/manager.py) to dynamically adjust confirmation needs (safety/classifier.py, orchestrator.py). Frequently used, low-risk commands in familiar contexts execute with minimal friction, while riskier operations still get detailed previews (safety/preview.py), balancing seamlessness with safety. Add detailed command history tracking (context/history.py).
Intelligent Error Analysis & Basic Fix Suggestions: When commands fail, use the AI (ai/parser.py, execution/engine.py) to analyze stderr in context. Proactively suggest potential fixes, relevant commands (e.g., ls if a file isn't found, permission checks), or documentation lookups based on the error message and command attempted.
Enhanced File/Directory Operations & Context: Implement more robust and complex file/directory operations (execution/filesystem.py) building on Phase 3 basics (e.g., recursive operations, pattern matching). Enhance context (context/filesystem.py) with reliable file type detection and basic metadata understanding to inform AI suggestions and operations.
Update the CLI interface to reflect these changes
Enhance the prompting system to better leverage conversational context



# We haev now implemented most of Phase 4
We've designed and implemented Phase 4 Part 2, 

angela/ai/intent_analyzer.py
angela/ai/confidence.py
angela/shell/formatter.py

Updated the existing files:

angela/orchestrator.py
angela/cli/main.py
angela/ai/prompts.py

This implementation enhances Angela-CLI with more intelligent interaction and contextual execution capabilities, making it more responsive, user-friendly, and adaptive. The focus on rich feedback, error analysis, and improved NLU will make Angela feel more like a true AI assistant rather than just a command translator.
Key Features Added:
Enhanced NLU with Tolerance for Variations: Angela can now understand misspellings and variations in user requests.
Interactive Clarification for Ambiguous Intents: When unsure, Angela will ask for clarification rather than executing potentially incorrect commands.
Rich Terminal Feedback: Real-time output streaming with spinners and progress indicators.
Intelligent Error Analysis: When commands fail, Angela analyzes the error and suggests fixes.
Context-Aware Command Suggestions: Leverages conversation history and project context for better suggestions.
These enhancements move Angela closer to being a true AI terminal agent, making the shell feel more intelligent and responsive.

Now we must implement teh next steps which is step 5 and any aspects we missed int step 4
### Step 5: Autonomous Task Orchestration & Proactive Assistance
(Focus: Enable high-level goal execution, deep content understanding, learning user workflows, and proactive behaviour.)
High-Level Goal Decomposition & Multi-Step Orchestration: Empower the AI (intent/planner.py, orchestrator.py) to break down complex user goals ("Deploy latest dev to staging") into sequences of commands/actions. Plan dependencies, visualize the execution flow (shell/formatter.py with rich), gain confirmation, and execute the orchestrated plan, monitoring progress and handling intermediate steps/errors gracefully.
Conversational Context & Session Memory: Implement robust session memory (context/manager.py, orchestrator.py) allowing Angela to understand follow-up commands referencing entities (files, outputs, errors) from the current interaction ("Try that again with sudo", "Analyze those errors").
AI-Powered File Content Comprehension & Manipulation: Integrate AI (ai/client.py, potentially new ai/content_analyzer.py) to understand the content of files (code functions, config values, text). Enable natural language requests for content-aware tasks like refactoring simple functions, updating configuration entries, or summarizing logs (execution/filesystem.py, safety/preview.py showing diffs). Create underlying utilities for safe content manipulation.
User-Defined Workflows via Natural Language: Allow users to teach Angela reusable multi-step workflows ("Define 'publish package' as: run tests, bump version, build, upload"). Angela (intent/planner.py, new workflows/manager.py) translates, confirms, saves, and allows invocation by the user-defined name.
Proactive Monitoring, Suggestions & Advanced Rollback: Implement optional background monitoring (orchestrator.py, asyncio) for contextual nudges (lint errors, git status, process crashes) via shell/formatter.py. Offer proactive suggestions/autofill based on deeper context (context/*, ai/*). Enhance rollback mechanisms (safety/*, execution/*) to specifically support undoing multi-step or content-manipulation actions where feasible, maintaining safety without hindering the autonomous capabilities.
