## Conclusion

This implementation significantly enhances Angela's code generation capabilities:

1. **Enhanced Multi-File Context Management**: The `GenerationContextManager` ensures coherent code generation across multiple files, tracking relationships, shared entities, and architectural patterns.

2. **Detailed Architecture Planning**: The enhanced `ProjectPlanner` creates sophisticated architectures with component relationships, layers, and patterns appropriate to the project type and framework.

3. **Improved Code Generation Engine**: The updated `CodeGenerationEngine` handles complex projects with better context management, improved dependency resolution, and higher-quality code generation.

4. **Interactive Refinement Loop**: The new `InteractiveRefiner` enables users to give natural language feedback to iteratively improve generated code.

5. **Framework Specialization**: Enhanced framework generators produce more complete, production-ready project structures following best practices.

6. **CLI Integration**: New commands provide access to these advanced capabilities with interactive refinement options.

These improvements enable Angela to generate substantial, well-structured codebases from high-level descriptions, making it a powerful tool for developers who want to kickstart projects or explore different architectural approaches.
