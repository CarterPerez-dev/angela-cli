Okay, acting as a Principal Software Architect and Senior Python Developer, I've performed a comprehensive review of the provided Angela-CLI codebase, considering its ambitious goals and phased development history.

Here is a detailed audit report, structured according to your requested areas:

**Executive Summary**

The Angela-CLI codebase represents a significant and ambitious undertaking, with many components reflecting the planned features outlined in the roadmap. The phased development is evident, with core modules for context, AI interaction, safety, and execution being substantially built out. Later phases, particularly around large-scale code generation (Phase 7) and advanced planning/orchestration (Phase 5 enhancements), show foundational elements but less mature integration into the main workflow.

Several key areas require attention:

1.  **Packaging and Imports:** Missing `__init__.py` files and potential import issues (unused, possibly circular) need immediate correction for stability and maintainability.
2.  **Consistency:** Error handling, logging patterns, and data flow mechanisms (especially with the introduction of the advanced planner) could be more consistent across modules.
3.  **Modularity and Responsibility:** While generally good, some overlaps (e.g., file handling) and unclear responsibilities (e.g., top-level `integrations`) exist.
4.  **Completeness:** Core orchestration seems functional, but the integration of advanced features like the generation engine and complex toolchain interactions needs further development and explicit wiring into the main flow.
5.  **Code Quality:** Basic linting issues and potential runtime errors (like `NameError`) were identified.

Addressing these points will significantly improve the robustness, maintainability, and overall architectural integrity of the codebase, paving the way for successful implementation of the advanced AGI-like features.

**Detailed Codebase Audit Report**

**1. `__init__.py` Files**

*   **Issue Description:** Several directories intended to be Python packages are missing the required `__init__.py` file.
*   **Location:**
    *   `angela/ai/`
    *   `angela/execution/`
    *   `angela/generation/`
    *   `angela/intent/` (Contains `__init__.py` but also `advanced_planner.py` which seems like a duplicate/alternative to `planner.py`) - *Correction:* `intent` *does* have `__init__.py`. The issue is the potential duplication/confusion between `planner.py` and `enhanced_task_planner.py`.
    *   `angela/review/`
    *   `angela/shell/` (Contains shell scripts but also `formatter.py` and `advanced_formatter.py`, suggesting it *should* be a package)
    *   `angela/toolchain/`
    *   `integrations/` (Top-level directory outside `angela/`)
    *   `angela/integrations/` (Contains `__init__.py` but its relationship to the top-level `integrations/` is unclear).
*   **Impact/Why it's a Problem:** Without `__init__.py`, these directories cannot be reliably imported as packages using standard Python import mechanisms (e.g., `import angela.ai.client`). This breaks packaging and can lead to `ImportError` or unexpected behavior depending on how the Python path is configured during execution. It also hinders namespace management. The top-level `integrations` directory is particularly problematic as it's outside the main `angela` package.
*   **Suggested Solution/Action:**
    *   Add an empty `__init__.py` file to each of the listed directories within the `angela` package (`ai`, `execution`, `generation`, `review`, `shell`, `toolchain`).
    *   Clarify the purpose of the top-level `integrations/` directory. If its contents (`integrations5.py`, `integrations6.py`) belong to the main application, move them into `angela/integrations/` (or a more appropriate location) and remove the top-level directory. If they are separate examples or utilities, document their purpose clearly.
    *   Review the contents of `angela/intent/` - clarify the roles of `planner.py` and `enhanced_task_planner.py`. If `enhanced_task_planner.py` is the intended replacement or extension, consider renaming or refactoring for clarity.
*   **Priority:** High (Critical for packaging and imports)

**2. Import Resolution & Module Linkage**

*   **Issue Description:** Potential missing, unused, or problematic imports. Specifically, the integration mechanism for the enhanced planner seems fragile.
*   **Location:**
    *   `angela/integrations/enhanced_planner_integration.py`: This file directly patches methods onto the `Orchestrator` class (`Orchestrator._process_multi_step_request = enhanced_process_multi_step_request`, etc.). It also imports `Orchestrator` and `task_planner`.
    *   `angela/orchestrator.py`: Imports `apply_enhanced_planner_integration` from `angela.integrations.enhanced_planner_integration` within its `init_application` function.
    *   `angela/execution/adaptive_engine.py`: Uses `registry.get("rollback_manager")` but doesn't explicitly import `RollbackManager`. (Handled by registry, but worth noting).
    *   `angela/cli/workflows.py`: Uses `await_func` which doesn't seem to be defined or imported anywhere in the provided code.
    *   `angela/orchestrator.py`: Imports `EnhancedContentAnalyzer` from `angela.ai.content_analyzer_extensions`, but the class defined there is `EnhancedContentAnalyzer` (case difference). Python imports are case-sensitive on some systems.
    *   `angela/intent/enhanced_task_planner.py`: Imports `execution_engine` and `rollback_manager` via the registry. Defines `EnhancedTaskPlanner` which seems to *replace* the global `task_planner` instance from `intent.planner`. This replacement mechanism is implicit and potentially confusing.
    *   General Scan: A full static analysis would be needed to catch all unused imports, but a manual scan didn't reveal widespread obvious cases beyond the patching/replacement concerns.
*   **Impact/Why it's a Problem:**
    *   Patching classes at runtime (`enhanced_planner_integration.py`) is generally discouraged. It makes the code harder to understand, debug, and refactor. It can lead to unexpected behavior depending on import order and creates tight coupling. It's a form of "monkey patching".
    *   The implicit replacement of `task_planner` in `enhanced_task_planner.py` is confusing. It's unclear if the original `TaskPlanner` is still used or completely superseded.
    *   `NameError` will occur in `cli/workflows.py` due to undefined `await_func`.
    *   Potential `ImportError` or `NameError` in `orchestrator.py` due to case sensitivity in `EnhancedContentAnalyzer` import if the filesystem is case-sensitive.
*   **Suggested Solution/Action:**
    *   **Refactor Enhanced Planner Integration:** Instead of patching `Orchestrator`, use composition or dependency injection. The `Orchestrator` could be initialized with a specific planner implementation (either the basic `TaskPlanner` or the `EnhancedTaskPlanner`). Alternatively, the `EnhancedTaskPlanner` could inherit from `TaskPlanner` and override methods explicitly.
    *   **Clarify Planner Usage:** Make the relationship between `TaskPlanner` and `EnhancedTaskPlanner` explicit. If the enhanced one is the standard, perhaps rename it or merge the functionality. Avoid replacing global instances implicitly.
    *   **Fix `await_func`:** Define or import the `await_func` helper in `cli/workflows.py` (likely `asyncio.run`).
    *   **Fix Import Case:** Correct the import in `orchestrator.py` to `from angela.ai.content_analyzer_extensions import EnhancedContentAnalyzer`.
    *   **Dependency Injection/Registry:** Continue using the service registry (`registry.py`) consistently where needed to break circular dependencies, but ensure components clearly declare their dependencies.
*   **Priority:** High (Patching is fragile; NameErrors break execution)

**3. Code Redundancy & Functional Duplication**

*   **Issue Description:** Potential overlap in responsibilities between different modules, particularly around file operations and error handling.
*   **Location:**
    *   `angela/ai/file_integration.py` vs. `angela/execution/filesystem.py`: Both deal with file operations. `file_integration` seems focused on *parsing* commands *into* file operations, while `filesystem` *executes* them.
    *   `angela/ai/analyzer.py` vs. `angela/execution/error_recovery.py`: Both handle errors. `analyzer` seems focused on analyzing errors for *user feedback* and suggestions, while `error_recovery` focuses on *programmatic recovery* during plan execution.
    *   `angela/intent/planner.py` vs. `angela/intent/enhanced_task_planner.py`: As noted before, significant overlap and potential replacement.
    *   `angela/shell/formatter.py` vs. `angela/shell/advanced_formatter.py`: Similar extension pattern via patching.
*   **Impact/Why it's a Problem:** Overlapping responsibilities can lead to duplicated logic, inconsistencies, and increased maintenance effort. Unclear boundaries make it harder to know which module to modify. The patching pattern for formatters, like the planner, is fragile.
*   **Suggested Solution/Action:**
    *   **File Operations:** Ensure a strict separation. `ai/file_integration` should *only* parse commands and translate them into structured operation requests (e.g., dicts defining operation type and parameters). `execution/filesystem` should *only* take these structured requests and execute them. Rename `ai/file_integration.py` to something like `ai/file_command_parser.py` to clarify its role.
    *   **Error Handling:** Maintain the separation. `ai/analyzer` is for user-facing analysis. `execution/error_recovery` is for internal plan recovery. Ensure they don't duplicate logic for *identifying* error types. Perhaps `error_recovery` could *use* `analyzer` internally.
    *   **Planners:** Refactor as suggested in section 2. Consolidate into a single planner module, possibly using inheritance or strategy pattern if different planning levels are truly needed.
    *   **Formatters:** Refactor the formatter extension. Use inheritance (`AdvancedTerminalFormatter(TerminalFormatter)`) or composition. The main application/orchestrator should decide which formatter instance to use.
*   **Priority:** Medium (Leads to maintenance issues and potential bugs)

**4. Orchestration Integrity (`orchestrator.py`)**

*   **Issue Description:** Assessing if `orchestrator.py` correctly integrates sub-modules as intended by the roadmap.
*   **Location:** `angela/orchestrator.py`
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Imports & Calls:** The orchestrator correctly imports and utilizes components from `ai` (client, prompts, parser, analyzer, intent_analyzer), `context` (manager, session, enhancer, file_resolver), `execution` (adaptive_engine), `safety` (via adaptive_engine), and `workflows` (manager).
    *   **Logical Flow:** The `process_request` method follows a reasonable flow: enhance context -> determine request type -> delegate to specific processing methods (`_process_command_request`, `_process_multi_step_request`, etc.).
    *   **Integration Points:** It integrates context enhancement, file resolution, intent analysis, AI suggestion generation, adaptive execution (which includes safety checks), and workflow management. The integration of the enhanced planner via patching is present but architecturally questionable.
    *   **Missing Connections:**
        *   **Generation Engine:** There are no explicit calls to `angela.generation.engine` or related modules within the main `process_request` flow. It's unclear how a user request like "create me a portfolio website" (Phase 7 goal) would currently trigger the generation engine via the orchestrator. This needs explicit integration, likely as a new `RequestType`.
        *   **Toolchain:** Similarly, direct integration with `angela.toolchain` modules (beyond Git calls potentially generated as commands) seems missing from the main orchestration flow. Tasks like "generate CI config" or "install dependencies" might need specific handling or request types.
        *   **Review:** The `review` module (`diff_manager`, `feedback`) doesn't appear to be called directly by the orchestrator. Feedback processing might be intended as a separate CLI command, but review loops for generated code aren't integrated into the main request flow.
*   **Impact/Why it's a Problem:** Missing integration points mean that core features described in later roadmap phases (especially Phase 7) are not yet functional through the main user interaction loop. The patching mechanism for the enhanced planner is a structural weakness.
*   **Suggested Solution/Action:**
    *   Introduce new `RequestType` enums and corresponding processing methods in `Orchestrator` for code generation, toolchain operations (like CI generation), and potentially feedback/refinement loops.
    *   Wire the `generation.engine` and `toolchain` modules into these new processing methods.
    *   Refactor the enhanced planner integration away from patching (as discussed previously).
    *   Clarify how code review/feedback is intended to be invoked (CLI command vs. part of generation flow).
*   **Priority:** High (Core features missing integration) / Medium (Patching weakness)

**5. Module Cohesion & Responsibility**

*   **Issue Description:** Assessing clarity and focus of modules based on structure and naming.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Good Cohesion:** Modules like `ai/client`, `context/manager`, `safety/classifier`, `execution/engine`, `utils/logging`, `config` seem well-defined and focused. The separation into `ai`, `cli`, `context`, `execution`, `generation`, `intent`, `monitoring`, `review`, `safety`, `shell`, `toolchain`, `utils`, `workflows` provides a logical top-level structure.
    *   **Areas for Improvement:**
        *   `ai/file_integration.py`: As mentioned, its responsibility overlaps conceptually with `execution/filesystem`. It's more about *parsing* commands related to files than *integrating* files with AI.
        *   `integrations/` (top-level): Purpose unclear. Seems like leftover files from development phases (`integrations5.py`, `integrations6.py`).
        *   `angela/integrations/`: Contains `enhanced_planner_integration.py`. Naming is vague. Is this for *internal* integrations or *external* ones? The current content suggests internal wiring.
        *   `intent/planner.py` vs. `intent/enhanced_task_planner.py`: Confusing duplication/replacement.
        *   `shell/`: Contains both shell scripts (`.bash`, `.zsh`) and Python formatters. Could potentially be split or clarified.
        *   `orchestrator.py`: Naturally has lower cohesion due to its role, but seems focused on orchestration.
*   **Impact/Why it's a Problem:** Low cohesion or unclear responsibilities make the codebase harder to navigate, understand, and maintain. It increases the chance of bugs when changes are made.
*   **Suggested Solution/Action:**
    *   Rename/move `ai/file_integration.py` (e.g., to `ai/command_parsers/file_parser.py` or similar).
    *   Remove or integrate the top-level `integrations/` directory.
    *   Rename `angela/integrations/` to something more specific if it only handles internal wiring (e.g., `angela/wiring/` or `angela/patches/` - though patching should be avoided). If intended for external integrations later, keep it but clean out current internal logic.
    *   Consolidate/clarify the planners in `intent/`.
    *   Consider moving Python formatters from `shell/` to a dedicated `ui/` or `formatting/` module if the `shell/` directory is primarily for shell scripts.
*   **Priority:** Medium

**6. Syntax Errors & Basic Linting Issues**

*   **Issue Description:** Identification of potential syntax errors or obvious linting problems.
*   **Location:**
    *   `angela/intent/enhanced_task_planner.py` (`_execute_python_code`, `_execute_javascript_code`, `_execute_shell_code`): Uses `getattr(step, "timeout", 30)` but `step` is not defined within the scope of these helper methods. It's likely intended to be passed as an argument or accessed via `self`.
    *   `angela/intent/enhanced_task_planner.py` (`_execute_loop_step`): Uses `find` without defining it (likely meant to find the step object from the plan).
    *   `angela/cli/workflows.py`: Uses undefined `await_func`.
    *   `angela/orchestrator.py`: Potential case-sensitivity issue importing `EnhancedContentAnalyzer`.
    *   General: Inconsistent use of `asyncio.run` within `async def` functions in CLI commands (e.g., `cli/files.py`, `cli/workflows.py`). `asyncio.run` should typically be called only once at the top level to start the event loop. Inside async functions, you should use `await`.
    *   General: Some deviations from PEP 8 (e.g., spacing, line length) might exist but require a dedicated linter run. No blatant, widespread PEP 8 violations jump out that indicate errors.
*   **Impact/Why it's a Problem:** `NameError` will cause runtime crashes. Inconsistent async usage can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. Case sensitivity issues cause `ImportError`.
*   **Suggested Solution/Action:**
    *   Pass `step` as an argument to `_execute_python_code`, `_execute_javascript_code`, and `_execute_shell_code` in `enhanced_task_planner.py` or access it via `self` if appropriate.
    *   Correct the logic in `_execute_loop_step` to properly retrieve the `body_step` object from `plan.steps`.
    *   Define or import `await_func` in `cli/workflows.py` (likely replace with `await`).
    *   Correct the import case in `orchestrator.py`.
    *   Refactor CLI command functions. If the main CLI entry point (`__main__.py`) uses `asyncio.run` or Typer handles the async loop, the command functions themselves should use `await` for async calls, not `asyncio.run`.
    *   Run a linter (like `flake8` or `pylint`) and auto-formatter (`black`, `isort`) across the codebase.
*   **Priority:** Critical (NameErrors/ImportErrors) / High (Async usage)

**7. Completeness of Implementation (Based on Roadmap Intent)**

*   **Issue Description:** Assessing if key modules mentioned in the roadmap appear substantially developed or are placeholders.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Phase 4 (Intelligent Interaction):** `ai/parser.py`, `intent/analyzer.py`, `safety/confirmation.py`, `execution/engine.py`, `shell/formatter.py`, `context/manager.py`, `safety/classifier.py`, `safety/preview.py`, `context/history.py`, `execution/filesystem.py`. These files generally seem implemented and contain significant logic, aligning with Phase 4 goals. `adaptive_confirmation.py` and `intent_analyzer.py` look functional.
    *   **Phase 5 (Autonomous Orchestration):** `intent/planner.py` exists but seems basic. `intent/enhanced_task_planner.py` contains the more complex logic (loops, code steps, API steps) and seems substantially developed, although its integration method is flawed. `context/manager.py` and `orchestrator.py` support session memory. `ai/content_analyzer.py` and `ai/content_analyzer_extensions.py` exist and contain logic. `workflows/manager.py` exists and seems functional. `monitoring/background.py` exists. `execution/rollback.py` seems enhanced with transaction support. *Phase 5 components appear largely implemented, but the advanced planner integration needs refinement.*
    *   **Phase 6 (Enhanced Context):** `context/enhancer.py`, `context/project_inference.py`, `context/file_resolver.py`, `context/file_activity.py` all exist and contain substantial logic. `ai/prompts.py` seems updated to use this context. *Phase 6 seems well-implemented.*
    *   **Phase 7 (Developer Tool Integration):** `generation/engine.py`, `generation/planner.py`, `generation/architecture.py`, `generation/frameworks.py`, `generation/validators.py`, `toolchain/git.py`, `toolchain/package_managers.py`, `toolchain/ci_cd.py`, `review/diff_manager.py`, `review/feedback.py`. These files exist and contain logic. However, their integration into the main `orchestrator` flow seems minimal or absent. The generation engine's ability to handle "massive" code generation isn't easily verifiable without execution but the structure is there. *Phase 7 components exist but seem underdeveloped in terms of integration and potentially complexity.*
*   **Impact/Why it's a Problem:** Underdeveloped or poorly integrated core components for later phases mean the full vision isn't realized yet. The advanced planner's integration method is a specific concern for Phase 5 functionality.
*   **Suggested Solution/Action:**
    *   Prioritize refactoring the integration of the `EnhancedTaskPlanner`.
    *   Explicitly integrate the `generation` engine and `toolchain` operations into the `Orchestrator` via new request types or specific commands.
    *   Develop more comprehensive tests for Phase 5, 6, and 7 components to verify their functionality beyond just existence.
*   **Priority:** High (Planner integration) / Medium (Phase 7 integration)

**8. Inter-Module Communication & Data Flow**

*   **Issue Description:** Assessing clarity and consistency of data exchange between modules.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Main Flow:** Primarily uses dictionaries (`context`, `result`). `context_manager.get_context_dict()` provides the base context, which is passed around and potentially enriched (e.g., by `context_enhancer`). Function return values are typically dictionaries containing results or suggestions.
    *   **Service Registry:** `core/registry.py` is used to decouple components like the execution engine and safety validators, accessed via `registry.get()`. This is a good pattern for breaking potential circular dependencies.
    *   **Advanced Planner:** `enhanced_task_planner.py` introduces its own internal data flow mechanism using `StepExecutionContext` and `_variables`. This seems more complex than the dictionary passing used elsewhere. How this internal state interacts with the broader application context needs careful management.
    *   **Data Models:** Pydantic models (`GeminiRequest`, `GeminiResponse`, `CommandSuggestion`, `Workflow`, `CodeProject`, etc.) are used effectively for structuring data within specific modules or for API interactions.
*   **Impact/Why it's a Problem:** Inconsistent data flow mechanisms (simple dicts vs. complex state objects in the planner) can make integration harder. Ensuring data consistency and avoiding state conflicts is crucial.
*   **Suggested Solution/Action:**
    *   Document the primary data flow patterns (context dict, result dicts).
    *   Clearly define how the `EnhancedTaskPlanner`'s internal state (`_variables`, `StepExecutionContext`) receives initial data from the main context and how its final results/variables are propagated back to the orchestrator or session.
    *   Consider using Pydantic models more broadly for passing complex data between major components (e.g., a `RequestContext` model) instead of relying solely on dictionaries, improving type safety and clarity.
*   **Priority:** Medium

**9. Configuration Management**

*   **Issue Description:** Assessing how configuration (like API keys) is loaded and accessed.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Loading:** `angela/config.py` defines a `ConfigManager` using Pydantic models (`AppConfig`, `ApiConfig`, `UserConfig`). It correctly loads from environment variables (`.env` file via `python-dotenv`) and a TOML configuration file (`~/.config/angela/config.toml`). The TOML loading/saving logic handles Python version differences (`tomllib` vs `tomli`) and uses `tomli-w` for writing.
    *   **Access:** Configuration is accessed via a global instance: `config_manager.config`. For example, `config_manager.config.api.gemini_api_key`.
    *   **Consistency:** This pattern seems consistently used where configuration is needed (e.g., `ai/client.py`, `constants.py`, `safety/confirmation.py` implicitly via `preferences_manager`).
*   **Impact/Why it's a Problem:** N/A - The current implementation appears robust and consistent.
*   **Suggested Solution/Action:** No immediate action needed. Maintain this consistent pattern. Ensure sensitive keys are correctly handled (e.g., loaded from env vars or a properly secured config file). The use of `.env.example` is good practice.
*   **Priority:** Low (Currently looks good)

**10. Error Handling Strategy**

*   **Issue Description:** Assessing the consistency and robustness of error handling.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Patterns:** Error handling appears somewhat ad-hoc. Standard exceptions (`ValueError`, `FileNotFoundError`, `Exception`, etc.) are caught in various places. Some functions return error dictionaries (e.g., `_apply_feature_changes`), while others raise exceptions.
    *   **Custom Exceptions:** `FileSystemError` is defined in `execution/filesystem.py` and raised there, which is good. However, other modules don't seem to define or use custom exceptions extensively.
    *   **Logging:** Errors are generally logged using the `logger` instance, often with `logger.exception` which includes stack traces.
    *   **Recovery:** `execution/error_recovery.py` introduces a more structured approach specifically for recovering from errors during *plan execution*.
    *   **User Feedback:** Errors encountered during command execution are sometimes analyzed by `ai/analyzer.py` to provide user-friendly suggestions.
*   **Impact/Why it's a Problem:** Inconsistent error handling makes it harder to predict program behavior and implement robust recovery mechanisms at higher levels (like the orchestrator). Relying solely on standard exceptions might not provide enough specific context about *what* went wrong within Angela's domain.
*   **Suggested Solution/Action:**
    *   Define a hierarchy of custom exceptions specific to Angela (e.g., `AngelaError`, `AIError`, `ExecutionError`, `ContextError`, `SafetyError`).
    *   Refactor modules to raise these custom exceptions when appropriate, providing more context than standard exceptions.
    *   Establish a consistent strategy in the `Orchestrator` for catching these exceptions and translating them into user-friendly error messages or triggering recovery mechanisms.
    *   Continue using the `ErrorRecoveryManager` for plan execution errors, but ensure it integrates well with the broader exception handling strategy.
*   **Priority:** Medium

**11. Missing Features (Based on Vision)**

*   **Issue Description:** Identifying potential gaps between the implemented codebase and the ambitious AGI-like vision.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **True Ambient Integration:** The current shell functions (`angela.bash`/`.zsh`) provide a basic alias. Achieving a truly "ambient" feel where the shell *itself* seems intelligent might require deeper integration, potentially involving shell plugins, terminal multiplexer integration, or more sophisticated input hooking beyond a simple function wrapper.
    *   **Profound Contextual Awareness:** While Phase 6 added significant context (project type, files, activity), achieving "profound" awareness (understanding code semantics deeply, tracking fine-grained user activity within files, inferring complex project states) requires ongoing development and potentially more advanced AI techniques beyond basic prompting.
    *   **Complex Intent Decomposition:** The advanced planner exists, but handling truly complex, ambiguous, multi-stage natural language goals reliably is an ongoing challenge for LLMs and requires sophisticated planning and validation logic.
    *   **Ecosystem Versatility:** Integration seems focused on Git, package managers, and CI config generation. Interfacing with Docker, cloud CLIs, databases, etc., as described in the vision, is largely unimplemented.
    *   **Massive Code Generation & CI/CD:** The generation engine and CI/CD components exist, but orchestrating the creation of *entire websites* or *fully automated CI/CD pipelines* from natural language requires significant further development and robust integration. The current implementation provides the building blocks but likely not the full end-to-end capability yet.
*   **Impact/Why it's a Problem:** The codebase provides a strong foundation, but significant work remains to fully realize the most ambitious aspects of the project vision.
*   **Suggested Solution/Action:**
    *   Focus on iterative refinement and integration of existing components (especially Phase 7).
    *   Prioritize features based on user value and technical feasibility.
    *   Investigate advanced shell integration techniques if the "ambient" feel is critical.
    *   Develop more sophisticated prompt engineering and potentially fine-tuning for complex code generation and planning tasks.
    *   Incrementally add support for more developer tools (Docker, cloud CLIs, etc.).
*   **Priority:** N/A (This is about future scope, not current bugs)

---

This audit provides a roadmap for stabilizing and improving the Angela-CLI codebase. Addressing the high-priority items related to packaging, imports, and critical errors should be the immediate focus. Following that, refactoring the planner/formatter integrations and ensuring consistent error handling and data flow will build a more robust foundation for implementing the advanced Phase 7+ features.
