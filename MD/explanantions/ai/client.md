**Purpose of `angela/ai/client.py` (in simple terms):**

Imagine Angela (the main program) wants to ask a really smart AI, like Google's "Gemini," a question or get it to write something. Angela doesn't know how to talk to Gemini directly.

This file, `client.py`, acts like **Angela's special messenger or direct phone line to Google's Gemini AI.**

Its job is to:

1.  **Get Ready:** It first checks if Angela has the secret "password" (called an API key) needed to talk to Gemini. If not, it says "Hey, we need that password!"
2.  **Send the Message:** When Angela has a question (a "prompt"), this file takes that question and sends it over the internet to Google's Gemini AI.
3.  **Get the Answer:** It waits for Gemini to think and send back an answer.
4.  **Deliver the Answer:** It takes Gemini's answer and gives it back to Angela in a neat, organized way.

**Simple Scenario:**

Let's say Angela wants to generate a cool story idea.

1.  **Angela thinks:** "I need a story idea about a cat who can talk."
2.  Angela gives this thought to `client.py` (this file).
3.  **`client.py` (the messenger):**
    *   Uses the secret API key.
    *   Sends the message to Google's Gemini AI: "Give me a story idea about a cat who can talk."
4.  **Google's Gemini AI (the big brain):** Thinks and comes up with: "A shy talking cat accidentally becomes a famous radio host, but must keep its identity a secret."
5.  **`client.py` (the messenger):**
    *   Receives this story idea from Gemini.
    *   Gives it back to Angela.
6.  **Angela:** "Cool! Now I have a story idea!"

**So, `client.py` is all about making the connection and handling the conversation between Angela and the powerful Google Gemini AI.** It makes sure messages are sent correctly and answers are received.
