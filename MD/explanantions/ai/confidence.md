Okay, let's simplify `angela/ai/confidence.py`:

**Purpose of `angela/ai/confidence.py` (in simple terms):**

Imagine Angela is trying to understand what you want it to do with your computer. You say something in plain English, like "show me my text files," and Angela suggests a computer command, like `ls *.txt`.

This file, `confidence.py`, is like Angela's **"How Sure Am I?" calculator.**

Its job is to figure out:

*   "How confident am I that the command `ls *.txt` is *really* what the user meant when they said 'show me my text files'?"

It gives a score (like 70% sure, or 95% sure). If the score is too low, Angela might ask you "Are you sure?" or try to think of a different command.

**How it decides the "sureness" score (simple analogy):**

Think of it like a detective trying to solve a case. It looks at different clues:

1.  **Past Experience (History):**
    *   "Have I suggested this `ls` command before for similar requests? Did it work well those times?"
    *   If yes, confidence goes up!

2.  **Matching Complexity:**
    *   "The user asked a short, simple question ('show me text files'). Is the command I came up with also pretty simple (`ls *.txt`)?"
    *   If the user's request was simple but the command is super long and complicated, confidence might go down.

3.  **Keywords Match (Entities):**
    *   "The user said 'text files'. Does my command `ls *.txt` actually deal with things that look like text files (like things ending in `.txt`)?"
    *   If the user mentioned "folder" but the command is about deleting a single file, confidence goes down.

4.  **Command Options Make Sense (Flags):**
    *   "Does the command use options that make sense together? For example, I wouldn't usually use an option to 'force' something and an option to 'ask for confirmation' at the same time for the same command."
    *   If the options look weird or contradictory, confidence goes down.

**Simple Scenario:**

*   **You say to Angela:** "List all my documents."
*   **Angela thinks of a command:** `ls ~/Documents`
*   **`confidence.py` kicks in and asks:**
    *   Has `ls` been used successfully for "list" requests before? (Probably yes: +confidence)
    *   "List all my documents" is fairly simple. `ls ~/Documents` is also simple. (Good match: +confidence)
    *   User said "documents," and the command uses `~/Documents` (a common documents folder). (Good match: +confidence)
    *   The command `ls ~/Documents` doesn't have any weird or clashing options. (Good: +confidence)
*   **Result:** `confidence.py` gives a high score (e.g., 90%). Angela feels good about suggesting `ls ~/Documents`.

If you said "Make my computer sing a song about cheese," and Angela somehow suggested `rm -rf /` (a very dangerous command to delete everything), `confidence.py` would hopefully look at the keywords ("sing," "song," "cheese") and see they don't match "delete everything" at all, and give a *very* low confidence score, so Angela wouldn't suggest it.

**So, this file helps Angela decide if its interpretation of your request and the command it came up with is a good, reliable guess.**
