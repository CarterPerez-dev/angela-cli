Okay, let's trace the journey of a code generation request through Angela, from a simple "create a file" to a complex "generate a whole project," and see which orchestrator functions and generation files get involved.

**Core Idea: User asks Angela to write code.**

Angela's approach to code generation can be broken down into a few levels of complexity:

1.  **Simple File Creation (with content):** User asks to create a single file with specific content.
2.  **Single File Generation (AI-driven):** User asks to generate a single code file based on a description (e.g., "create a Python function to sort a list").
3.  **Adding a Feature to an Existing Project:** User asks to implement a new feature, which might involve creating new files and modifying existing ones.
4.  **Generating a Standard Framework Project:** User asks for a new project using a known framework (e.g., "create a new React app").
5.  **Generating a Complex/Custom Project from Scratch:** User describes a whole application, and Angela plans and generates the entire multi-file structure and code.
6.  **Refining Generated Code:** User provides feedback on code Angela generated, and Angela improves it.

---

**Scenario 1: Simple File Creation (User provides content)**

*   **User Request:** `angela request "create a file named hello.txt with the content 'Hello, Angela!'" `
*   **Orchestrator Flow (`orchestrator.py`):**
    1.  `process_request()`:
        *   Gets context.
        *   `_determine_request_type()`: Might initially classify this as `RequestType.COMMAND` or `RequestType.FILE_CONTENT` (specifically manipulation if it detects "create file with content"). Let's assume it leans towards a file operation.
        *   If it's seen as a direct file operation, it might try to use `ai/file_integration.py` to parse "create file named hello.txt with content 'Hello, Angela!'" into parameters for `execution/filesystem.py`.
        *   `_process_file_content_request()` (or a similar direct file op handler):
            *   `_extract_file_path()`: Identifies "hello.txt".
            *   `_determine_file_operation_type()`: Identifies "manipulate" (or a more specific "create_with_content").
            *   It would then call `content_analyzer.manipulate_content()` or directly `execution_engine.execute_command("echo 'Hello, Angela!' > hello.txt")` after safety checks, or more likely, use `execution/filesystem.py`'s `write_file("hello.txt", "Hello, Angela!")`.
            *   **Rollback:** `rollback_manager.record_file_operation()` would be called by `filesystem.py` to log the creation, possibly backing up `hello.txt` if it was being overwritten.
*   **Generation Files Involved:**
    *   Minimal direct involvement from the `generation/` directory for this simple case. The AI might be used by `file_integration.py` to parse the request into structured parameters if the request was more natural language like "make a file called hello and put 'Hello, Angela!' in it".

---

**Scenario 2: Single File Generation (AI-driven content)**

*   **User Request:** `angela request "generate a python script that prints numbers from 1 to 10 and save it as counter.py"`
*   **Orchestrator Flow (`orchestrator.py`):**
    1.  `process_request()`:
        *   Gets context.
        *   `_determine_request_type()`: Identifies this as `RequestType.CODE_GENERATION` (or possibly `FILE_CONTENT` with a "generate content" intent). Let's assume `CODE_GENERATION` due to "generate a python script".
        *   `_process_code_generation_request()` (or a similar handler):
            *   `_extract_project_details()` (or simpler logic for single file): Extracts target filename "counter.py", language "python", and the description "prints numbers from 1 to 10".
            *   It would then call a function, likely within `generation/engine.py` (e.g., a hypothetical `code_generation_engine.generate_single_file(...)`).
*   **Generation Files Involved (`generation/`):**
    *   `engine.py` (`CodeGenerationEngine`):
        *   `_generate_file_content()` (or a similar specialized method for single files):
            *   `_build_file_content_prompt()`: Creates a prompt for the AI: "Generate Python code for file 'counter.py' with purpose 'prints numbers from 1 to 10'. Code should be..."
            *   `ai/client.py` is used to send this to Gemini.
            *   `_extract_code_from_response()`: Gets the Python code from the AI's response.
            *   `validators.py` (`validate_code` -> `validate_python`): Checks if the generated Python code is syntactically valid. If not, it might try to ask the AI to fix it.
        *   The orchestrator (or the generation engine) would then use `execution/filesystem.py`'s `write_file("counter.py", generated_python_code)` to save the file.
        *   **Rollback:** `rollback_manager.record_file_operation()` is called by `filesystem.py`.
*   **Key Idea:** The orchestrator identifies the need for code generation, and the `CodeGenerationEngine` handles the AI interaction to get the code, validates it, and saves it.

---

**Scenario 3: Adding a Feature to an Existing Project**

*   **User Request:** `angela request "add a feature to my Flask app to handle user logout in auth_routes.py"`
*   **Orchestrator Flow (`orchestrator.py`):**
    1.  `process_request()`:
        *   Gets context (current project is Flask, `auth_routes.py` exists).
        *   `_determine_request_type()`: Identifies `RequestType.FEATURE_ADDITION`.
        *   `_process_feature_addition_request()`:
            *   `_extract_feature_details()`: Uses AI to understand the feature is "user logout" and the target file is `auth_routes.py`.
            *   Calls `generation/engine.py`'s `code_generation_engine.add_feature_to_project(...)`.
*   **Generation Files Involved (`generation/`):**
    *   `engine.py` (`CodeGenerationEngine`):
        *   `add_feature_to_project()`:
            *   `_analyze_existing_project()`: Scans the project (especially `auth_routes.py` and related files) to understand its current structure and style. This might use `context/project_inference.py` or `ai/semantic_analyzer.py`.
            *   `_generate_feature_plan()`: Sends a prompt to AI: "Given this Flask project structure and `auth_routes.py`, and the request to add user logout, what new files are needed (if any) and what modifications to `auth_routes.py` are required? Provide a plan (e.g., add a `/logout` route, a `logout_user()` function, update imports)."
            *   `_parse_feature_plan()`: Parses the AI's plan (which might specify adding a new function to `auth_routes.py`).
            *   `_generate_feature_files()`:
                *   If new files are planned, calls `_generate_new_file_content()` for them.
                *   For `auth_routes.py`, it calls `_apply_file_modifications()`. This function might try to apply structured modifications first (e.g., "add this function after function X"). If that's too complex or fails, it calls `_generate_file_modifications_with_ai()` which sends the original content of `auth_routes.py` and the modification instructions ("add a logout function and route") to the AI to get the fully modified file content.
            *   `_apply_feature_changes()`: Uses `execution/filesystem.py`'s `write_file` to save the new/modified files.
            *   `_extract_dependencies_from_feature()`: After code is generated/modified, this function (using regex or semantic analysis) checks if new dependencies (e.g., `flask_login.logout_user`) were introduced.
        *   The orchestrator might then suggest running `toolchain/package_managers.py` to install any new dependencies.
*   **Key Idea:** The `CodeGenerationEngine` analyzes the existing project, plans the changes with AI, generates new code or modifies existing code using AI, and then applies these changes. `generation/context_manager.py` might be used by the engine during multi-file generation within the feature to keep track of newly defined symbols.

**Scenario 4: Generating a Standard Framework Project**

*   **User Request:** `angela generate create-framework-project react "a simple portfolio website"`
    *   (Note: This might also be invoked via `angela request "create a new react project for a portfolio"`, where the orchestrator determines `RequestType.CODE_GENERATION` and then might delegate to a framework-specific path if "react" is identified as a framework).
*   **Orchestrator Flow (`orchestrator.py`):**
    1.  `process_request()` (if coming from natural language) or directly via `cli/generation.py`.
    2.  If `RequestType.CODE_GENERATION` is determined and a framework is identified, it might call a specialized handler or the `cli/generation.py` command might directly invoke `generation/frameworks.py`.
*   **Generation Files Involved (`generation/`):**
    *   `frameworks.py` (`FrameworkGenerator`):
        *   `generate_framework_structure()` (or `generate_standard_project_structure()` which might call the former or an enhanced version like `_generate_enhanced_react()`):
            *   Recognizes "react".
            *   Calls its internal `_generate_react()` (or `_generate_nextjs()`, `_generate_enhanced_react()`).
            *   This internal method has predefined templates/structures for React projects (e.g., `public/index.html`, `src/App.js`, `package.json`).
            *   For each file in its predefined structure, it calls `self._generate_content("react/App.js", description, options)`.
            *   `_generate_content()` in turn calls `self._generate_file_content(...)` which is a generic AI call to fill in the template or generate content based on the file's purpose, project description, and framework.
            *   The result is a list of `CodeFile` objects.
    *   `engine.py` (`CodeGenerationEngine`):
        *   The `cli/generation.py` (or orchestrator) would then likely pass the `CodeProject` (built from the `CodeFile`s from `FrameworkGenerator`) to `code_generation_engine.create_project_files()` to write them to disk.
*   **Key Idea:** `FrameworkGenerator` provides the *structure* and *boilerplate* for known frameworks. The actual content of individual files is still often generated by AI via `_generate_file_content`, but guided by the framework's conventions and the file's specific role within that framework.

---

**Scenario 5: Generating a Complex/Custom Project from Scratch**

*   **User Request:** `angela generate create-complex-project "A multi-user blogging platform with Python backend (Flask or Django), React frontend, user auth, posts, comments, and admin panel"`
*   **Orchestrator Flow (`orchestrator.py`):**
    1.  `cli/generation.py`'s `create_complex_project` function is invoked.
    2.  This function directly calls `generation/engine.py`'s `code_generation_engine.generate_complex_project(...)`.
*   **Generation Files Involved (`generation/`):**
    *   `engine.py` (`CodeGenerationEngine`):
        *   `generate_complex_project()`:
            *   `_infer_project_type()` and `_infer_framework()`: Determines primary language/framework (e.g., Python, Django).
            *   `_extract_project_name()`: Gets a name like "multi_user_blogging_platform".
            *   `planner.py` (`ProjectPlanner`):
                *   `create_detailed_project_architecture()`: This is a key step. It sends the detailed description to the AI, asking it to design an architecture (components, layers, patterns, data flow, relationships). The result is a `ProjectArchitecture` object.
                *   `generation/context_manager.py` (`generation_context_manager`): The generated architecture is stored here globally for the generation process.
                *   `create_project_plan_from_architecture()`: Converts the `ProjectArchitecture` into a `CodeProject` object, which is a list of `CodeFile`s with their paths, purposes, and initial dependencies based on the architectural components.
            *   `generation/context_manager.py` (`generation_context_manager`):
                *   `analyze_code_relationships()`: Analyzes the planned `CodeFile`s to understand their interdependencies more deeply (though at this stage, content isn't generated yet, so it's based on planned structure).
            *   `_generate_complex_file_contents()`: This is the core content generation loop.
                *   `_build_dependency_graph()` and `_create_file_batches()`: Orders the planned files so that dependencies are generated before the files that use them. Files that can be generated in parallel are batched.
                *   For each file in a batch:
                    *   `_generate_complex_file_content()`:
                        *   `_build_complex_file_content_prompt()`: Creates a very detailed prompt for the AI. This prompt includes the file's path, purpose, language, its role in the architecture (e.g., "Data Model for Users"), the overall project description, project structure, and importantly, *content previews of already generated dependency files*.
                        *   `generation/context_manager.py`'s `enhance_prompt_with_context()`: Further enriches this prompt with global context, info about already defined API endpoints, database models, UI components, and specific dependencies.
                        *   `ai/client.py` sends this rich prompt to Gemini.
                        *   `_extract_code_from_response()` gets the code.
                        *   `validators.py` checks the code. If invalid, AI might be asked to fix it.
                        *   The generated content is stored in the `CodeFile` object.
                        *   `generation/context_manager.py`'s `extract_entities_from_file()`: Parses the newly generated code to register its defined classes, functions, etc., so subsequent files can be aware of them.
    *   `cli/generation.py` (after `generate_complex_project` returns the `CodeProject`):
        *   Might offer an interactive refinement step using `generation/refiner.py`.
        *   Calls `code_generation_engine.create_project_files()` to write all generated files to disk.
        *   Optionally calls `toolchain/git.py` to init a repo, `toolchain/package_managers.py` to install dependencies, `toolchain/test_frameworks.py` to generate tests, and `toolchain/ci_cd.py` to set up CI.
*   **Key Idea:** This is the most sophisticated generation. It involves AI-driven architectural planning, then AI-driven content generation for each file, with a strong emphasis on maintaining context (what's already been generated, what this file's role is, what it depends on) to ensure the whole project is coherent. `generation/context_manager.py` is vital here.

---

**Scenario 6: Refining Generated Code**

*   **User Request:** `angela generate refine-code "add error handling to the login function in auth.py" --file auth.py`
*   **Orchestrator Flow (`orchestrator.py`):**
    1.  `cli/generation.py`'s `refine_code` function is called.
    2.  It calls `generation/refiner.py`'s `interactive_refiner.process_refinement_feedback(...)`.
*   **Generation Files Involved (`generation/`):**
    *   `refiner.py` (`InteractiveRefiner`):
        *   `process_refinement_feedback()`:
            *   `_analyze_feedback_for_files()`: Determines `auth.py` is the target.
            *   `_process_file_feedback()`:
                *   `_build_file_context()`: Gathers context about `auth.py` and the project.
                *   `review/feedback.py` (`FeedbackManager`):
                    *   `process_feedback()`:
                        *   `_build_improvement_prompt()`: Sends the original code of `auth.py`, the feedback "add error handling to login function", and context to the AI.
                        *   AI returns improved code and an explanation.
                        *   `_extract_improved_code()`: Parses this.
                        *   `review/diff_manager.py` generates a diff.
                *   The `InteractiveRefiner` gets this result (improved code, diff, explanation).
    *   `cli/generation.py`:
        *   Displays the diff and explanation.
        *   If user confirms with `--apply`, it calls `feedback_manager.apply_refinements()` which uses `diff_manager.apply_diff()` (or writes the full improved code) to update `auth.py`.
*   **Key Idea:** User provides natural language feedback on existing code. AI is used to understand the feedback and rewrite the code accordingly. Diffs are shown for review.

---

**Orchestrator Delegation Summary for Generation:**

*   **`_determine_request_type()`**: Identifies if the request is `CODE_GENERATION`, `FEATURE_ADDITION`, `CODE_REFINEMENT`, or `CODE_ARCHITECTURE`.
*   **`_process_code_generation_request()`**:
    *   Delegates to `generation/engine.py` (`code_generation_engine.generate_project`) for planning and content generation.
    *   May use `_extract_project_details()` (AI call) to understand project parameters from the request.
*   **`_process_feature_addition_request()`**:
    *   Delegates to `generation/engine.py` (`code_generation_engine.add_feature_to_project`).
    *   May use `_extract_feature_details()` (AI call).
*   **`_process_code_refinement_request()`**:
    *   Delegates to `review/feedback.py` (`feedback_manager.process_feedback` or `feedback_manager.refine_project`).
    *   The `cli/generation.py` command for this likely calls `generation/refiner.py` which then uses `feedback_manager`.
*   **`_process_code_architecture_request()`**:
    *   Delegates to `generation/architecture.py` (`architectural_analyzer.analyze_architecture`).

In all these generation scenarios, the `generation/` modules will heavily rely on `ai/client.py` to talk to Gemini, `ai/prompts.py` (and `enhanced_prompts.py`) to formulate good questions for the AI, and `ai/parser.py` to understand the AI's structured responses (like JSON plans). `generation/validators.py` is used to check the generated code quality. `generation/context_manager.py` is crucial for complex, multi-file generation to maintain coherence.
