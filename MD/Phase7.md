In this Phase 7 implementation, I've added comprehensive developer tool integration to Angela CLI, focusing on these key areas:

Advanced Code Generation Engine

Core generation engine for creating entire projects from descriptions
Project planner for designing comprehensive architectures
File content generation with inter-file dependency resolution
Code validation with language-specific syntax checkers


Toolchain Integration

Git integration for repository initialization and change management
Package manager integration (npm, pip, cargo, etc.) for dependency installation
Test framework integration to generate appropriate tests
CI/CD platform integration for DevOps configuration


Interactive Code Review

Diff management for comparing original and improved code
Feedback processing for refining existing code
Project-wide refinement based on natural language feedback


CLI Extensions

New commands for creating projects, adding features, and refining code
Interface for generating tests and CI configurations
Rich terminal output for better user experience



This implementation brings together all the previous phases (context awareness, file operations, workflow management) to provide a comprehensive developer experience. Users can now describe what they want in natural language, and Angela CLI will generate the appropriate code structures, handle dependencies, initialize source control, generate tests, and set up CI/CD pipelines.
Next Steps
After implementing Phase 7, here are some potential next steps for further enhancing Angela CLI:

Advanced Language Support

Add more language-specific generators and validators
Support for specialized frameworks (e.g., React, Django, Spring)
Language-specific refactoring and optimization suggestions


Collaborative Coding Improvements

Pull request generation and management
Code review suggestions based on common patterns
Integration with code quality tools (ESLint, Pylint, etc.)


Architectural Analysis

Deeper understanding of project architecture
Suggestions for architectural improvements
Detection of anti-patterns and technical debt


Project Evolution Tracking

Long-term project understanding
Context-aware suggestions based on project history
Performance and quality metrics over time


Enhanced Context Awareness

Integration with more developer tools (IDEs, issue trackers)
Documentation generation and management
Learning from user coding patterns and preferences



These improvements would further cement Angela CLI as an intelligent assistant throughout the entire software development lifecycle.
