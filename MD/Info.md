Okay, acting as Principal Architect and Senior Developer, let's dive deep into the Angela-CLI codebase based on the provided `repomix-output.xml` and your project descriptions.

This is a comprehensive analysis focusing on the potential inconsistencies, missing pieces, and architectural weaknesses you're concerned about due to the phased development.

**Executive Summary:**

The Angela-CLI project shows a well-thought-out modular structure aligned with its ambitious goals. The separation into `ai`, `context`, `execution`, `intent`, `safety`, `generation`, `toolchain`, etc., is logical. However, the phased development appears to have left some integration gaps, potential redundancies, and areas needing refinement, particularly in the orchestration layer and the full realization of the advanced features described in later phases (like the advanced planner execution and deep toolchain integration). The core foundation seems solid, but the connections and full implementation details require attention.

**Detailed Codebase Review & Analysis:**

Here's a breakdown based on your specific areas of concern:

**1. `__init__.py` Files:**

*   **Issue Description:** Verification of package markers (`__init__.py`).
*   **Location:** All subdirectories within `angela/`.
*   **Findings:**
    *   Based on the provided file list (`repomix-output.xml`), most core directories intended as packages (`ai`, `cli`, `context`, `core`, `execution`, `generation`, `intent`, `interfaces`, `monitoring`, `review`, `safety`, `toolchain`, `utils`, `workflows`) **do contain** an `__init__.py` file. This is good practice.
    *   The `integrations/` directory *within* `angela/` also has an `__init__.py`.
    *   The top-level `integrations/` directory (outside `angela/`) *does not* have an `__init__.py`. If `integrations5.py` and `integrations6.py` are meant to be part of an `integrations` package accessible via `import integrations`, this is missing. However, their usage pattern isn't clear from the provided code snippets.
    *   The top-level `MD/` and `scripts/` directories correctly *do not* have `__init__.py` as they are not intended to be Python packages.
*   **Impact:** Missing `__init__.py` prevents Python from treating a directory as a package, leading to `ImportError` if you try to import modules from it using package notation.
*   **Suggested Solution:**
    *   If the top-level `integrations/` directory is intended to be importable as a package, add an empty `integrations/__init__.py` file.
    *   If `integrations5.py` and `integrations6.py` are standalone scripts or used differently, no action is needed for `__init__.py`. Clarify their role.
*   **Priority:** Medium (if top-level `integrations` is meant to be a package).

**2. Import Resolution & Module Linkage:**

*   **Issue Description:** Checking for missing, incorrect, circular, or unused imports.
*   **Location:** All `.py` files within `angela/`.
*   **Findings:**
    *   **Missing Imports:** Difficult to be certain without full execution, but some potential gaps:
        *   `angela/integrations/enhanced_planner_integration.py`: Imports `Orchestrator`, `TaskPlan`, etc. Assumes these are correctly available. It also imports `registry` from `angela.core.registry`. This seems okay.
        *   `angela/orchestrator.py`: Imports heavily from many submodules. This is expected for an orchestrator. The imports *look* correct based on the file structure (e.g., `from angela.ai.client import ...`).
        *   `angela/execution/rollback.py`: Imports `diff_manager` and `execution_engine`. Seems plausible.
        *   `angela/generation/frameworks.py`: Imports `CodeFile` from `angela.generation.engine`. Seems correct.
    *   **Incorrect Imports:** No glaringly incorrect import paths were obvious in the reviewed snippets, assuming the `angela` package is correctly installed or in the Python path.
    *   **Circular Dependencies (Potential):**
        *   The most likely candidate for circular dependencies involves `orchestrator.py` and the modules it calls, *if* those modules also need to import `orchestrator`. The use of `registry.py` in `enhanced_planner_integration.py` to get `rollback_manager` is a good pattern to *avoid* circular imports. We need to check if modules like `adaptive_engine`, `task_planner`, `content_analyzer`, etc., import `orchestrator` directly. *Based on snippets, `adaptive_engine` imports `registry`, which is good. `rollback` imports `execution_engine`. Need to verify others.*
    *   **Unused Imports:** Cannot definitively determine without static analysis tools (like `flake8` or `pylint`), but a manual scan didn't reveal obvious unused imports in the provided snippets. `json` is imported in `config.py` but seemingly only `tomllib` and `tomli_w` are used for the primary config logic â€“ `json` might be unused there.
*   **Impact:** Missing/incorrect imports cause `ImportError`. Circular dependencies can cause difficult-to-diagnose runtime errors or prevent modules from loading correctly. Unused imports add clutter.
*   **Suggested Solution:**
    *   Run a static analysis tool (`flake8`, `pylint`) to automatically detect unused imports and potential import errors.
    *   Manually trace import chains for key modules like `orchestrator`, `execution_engine`, `task_planner` to confirm no circular dependencies exist. Refactor using the `registry` or dependency injection if cycles are found.
    *   Review the role of the top-level `integrations/` directory and its files to ensure imports are handled correctly if it's meant to be a package.
*   **Priority:** High (for potential circular dependencies or missing imports), Low (for unused imports).

**3. Code Redundancy & Functional Duplication:**

*   **Issue Description:** Identifying overlapping functionality.
*   **Location:** Across various modules, specifically comparing `ai/file_integration.py` and `execution/filesystem.py`. Also `intent/planner.py` vs `intent/enhanced_task_planner.py`.
*   **Findings:**
    *   **`ai/file_integration.py` vs. `execution/filesystem.py`:** There appears to be significant potential overlap. `ai/file_integration.py` focuses on *extracting* file operation intent from commands (e.g., parsing `mkdir`, `cp`, `rm`) and then *calling* functions in `execution/filesystem.py` (like `create_directory`, `copy_file`). This separation seems logical: `ai/file_integration` translates AI/command intent, while `execution/filesystem` performs the actual, safe OS interaction. However, the logic for parsing command arguments within `ai/file_integration.py` might become complex and could potentially be simplified or made more robust. The core file operations themselves seem correctly delegated to `filesystem.py`.
    *   **`intent/planner.py` vs. `intent/enhanced_task_planner.py`:** The presence of both suggests an evolution. `enhanced_task_planner.py` seems intended to provide the more advanced execution logic (CODE, API, LOOP steps). `enhanced_planner_integration.py` explicitly patches `Orchestrator` to use the enhanced planner. This suggests `intent/planner.py` might contain the *models* (`TaskPlan`, `PlanStep`) and perhaps the *basic* planning logic, while `enhanced_task_planner.py` contains the advanced execution engine. This needs verification. Is the original `TaskPlanner` class still used elsewhere, or is `EnhancedTaskPlanner` the primary one now? The integration file suggests the latter.
    *   **Other Potential Areas:** Check `safety/validator.py` vs. `safety/classifier.py` - ensure clear separation between validating *if* an operation is allowed vs. *classifying* its risk. Check `cli/files.py` vs. `execution/filesystem.py` - `cli/files.py` should primarily handle user interaction and call `execution/filesystem.py` for the actual work.
*   **Impact:** Redundancy increases maintenance overhead and potential for inconsistencies. Unclear responsibility boundaries make the code harder to understand and modify.
*   **Suggested Solution:**
    *   **File Ops:** Confirm that `ai/file_integration.py` *only* parses command intent and delegates *all* actual file system changes to `execution/filesystem.py`. Ensure `filesystem.py` contains all core file manipulation logic.
    *   **Planners:** Clarify the roles. If `EnhancedTaskPlanner` is the primary execution engine, ensure all planning logic eventually uses it. Consider renaming or restructuring to make the relationship clearer (e.g., `intent/models.py`, `intent/basic_planner.py`, `intent/advanced_planner.py`, `intent/execution_engine.py`). Ensure the `Orchestrator` consistently uses the intended planner.
    *   Review other potentially overlapping modules (`safety`, `cli`) for clear responsibility boundaries.
*   **Priority:** Medium.

**4. Orchestration Integrity (`angela/orchestrator.py`):**

*   **Issue Description:** Verifying `orchestrator.py` correctly integrates sub-modules according to the project design.
*   **Location:** `angela/orchestrator.py`.
*   **Findings:**
    *   The provided `process_request` method in `integrations6.py` shows integration with:
        *   `context_manager`, `session_manager`, `context_enhancer`, `file_resolver` (Context gathering - Phase 6 seems integrated here).
        *   `intent_analyzer` (via `_determine_request_type` - Phase 4).
        *   Calls specific processing methods (`_process_command_request`, `_process_multi_step_request`, etc.).
    *   The `_process_multi_step_request` method (patched by `enhanced_planner_integration.py`) correctly calls `task_planner.plan_task` and `task_planner.execute_plan`. This integrates the planning (Phase 5).
    *   The `_process_command_request` method calls `_get_ai_suggestion` (Phase 3 AI integration), `confidence_scorer` (Phase 4), and `adaptive_engine.execute_command` (Phase 4 execution).
    *   The `_process_file_content_request` method calls `content_analyzer` (Phase 5).
    *   The workflow methods call `workflow_manager` (Phase 5).
    *   **Potential Gaps/Questions:**
        *   How is the `error_recovery_manager` invoked? The `_process_multi_step_request` handles exceptions but doesn't explicitly call the recovery manager in the provided snippet. The *enhanced* planner execution logic in `enhanced_task_planner.py` *does* seem to integrate it. Need to ensure this path is always taken for multi-step tasks.
        *   How does the `monitoring` system (Phase 5) feed information back or get triggered by the orchestrator? The `monitoring/background.py` seems standalone.
        *   How does the `generation` engine (Phase 7) get invoked? There's no `_process_generation_request` method shown.
        *   How does the `toolchain` integration (Phase 7) get triggered?
*   **Impact:** Missing connections mean features described in the roadmap won't work as intended. The orchestrator might not be leveraging all available components.
*   **Suggested Solution:**
    *   Explicitly add calls within `orchestrator.py` (or the relevant sub-processing methods) to invoke the `generation` engine, `toolchain` components, and potentially interact with the `monitoring` system based on request types or context.
    *   Ensure the `_process_multi_step_request` consistently uses the `EnhancedTaskPlanner`'s execution logic which includes error recovery.
    *   Map out the full request lifecycle for different request types (simple command, multi-step, generation, file op) and verify the orchestrator calls the correct sequence of modules.
*   **Priority:** High.

**5. Module Cohesion & Responsibility:**

*   **Issue Description:** Assessing if modules have clear, single responsibilities.
*   **Location:** Overall project structure (`angela/` subdirectories).
*   **Findings:**
    *   **Generally Good:** The high-level structure (`ai`, `context`, `execution`, `intent`, `safety`, `generation`, `toolchain`, `workflows`, `review`, `monitoring`, `cli`, `shell`, `utils`, `core`, `interfaces`) seems logical and promotes separation of concerns.
    *   **`ai/` Module:** Seems cohesive, focused on AI interaction, parsing, analysis. `content_analyzer_extensions.py` suggests a good pattern for extending base functionality.
    *   **`context/` Module:** Appears well-defined, handling various aspects of context (session, history, project, files).
    *   **`execution/` Module:** Contains execution engines, filesystem ops, rollback, hooks, error recovery. Seems cohesive. The presence of `rollback_commands.py` here *might* be slightly misplaced if it only contains CLI command definitions (better in `cli/`), but if it contains core rollback *logic* triggered by commands, it's acceptable. *Need to check its content.*
    *   **`intent/` Module:** Contains models and planners. The `enhanced_task_planner.py` might be better named `advanced_executor.py` or similar if it primarily handles execution logic, leaving `planner.py` for planning itself.
    *   **`generation/` Module:** Contains `engine`, `planner`, `architecture`, `documentation`, `frameworks`, `validators`. This looks cohesive for code generation tasks.
    *   **`toolchain/` Module:** `git.py`, `package_managers.py`, `ci_cd.py`. Clear and focused.
    *   **`integrations/` (within `angela/`):** Contains `enhanced_planner_integration.py`. This is a specific integration patch. It might be better placed within the `intent` or `execution` module, or kept here if more cross-cutting integrations are planned. The top-level `integrations/` directory is unclear.
*   **Impact:** Poor cohesion makes modules harder to understand, test, and maintain. Unclear responsibilities lead to duplicated logic or tangled dependencies.
*   **Suggested Solution:**
    *   Clarify the role of `intent/enhanced_task_planner.py` vs. `intent/planner.py`. Consider renaming or restructuring if `enhanced_task_planner.py` is primarily about *executing* advanced plans.
    *   Review the content of `execution/rollback_commands.py`. If it defines Typer commands, move it to `angela/cli/`.
    *   Decide on a consistent strategy for integration code (like `enhanced_planner_integration.py`). Keep it in `integrations/` or move it closer to the components it connects?
    *   Clarify the purpose of the top-level `integrations/` directory and its files.
*   **Priority:** Medium.

**6. Syntax Errors & Basic Linting Issues:**

*   **Issue Description:** Scanning for obvious syntax errors and major linting issues.
*   **Location:** All `.py` files.
*   **Findings:**
    *   **Syntax:** No obvious syntax errors were detected in the provided snippets. The code appears syntactically valid Python.
    *   **Linting (Visual Scan):**
        *   Imports seem generally well-organized (standard library, third-party, local).
        *   Naming conventions (snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes) seem mostly consistent.
        *   Some long lines might exist, but not excessively apparent in snippets.
        *   Use of f-strings for logging is good.
        *   Pydantic models are used effectively for data structures.
        *   Async/await usage seems appropriate where needed (e.g., API calls, async execution).
*   **Impact:** Syntax errors prevent execution. Linting issues reduce readability and maintainability.
*   **Suggested Solution:**
    *   Run `flake8` and `black` (as defined in `Makefile`) across the entire codebase to enforce style consistency and catch potential linting errors automatically.
    *   Run `mypy` (also in `Makefile`) for static type checking, which can catch subtle bugs.
*   **Priority:** Medium (for running linters/formatters).

**7. Completeness of Implementation (Based on Roadmap Intent):**

*   **Issue Description:** Checking if key files mentioned in the roadmap have substantial implementations.
*   **Location:** Key files related to roadmap phases.
*   **Findings:**
    *   **Phase 4 Files:** `intent_analyzer.py`, `confidence.py`, `formatter.py`, `adaptive_engine.py`, `history.py`, `analyzer.py` all appear to have substantial implementations based on the provided code. `safety/adaptive_confirmation.py` also seems implemented. `execution/filesystem.py` looks well-developed.
    *   **Phase 5 Files:** `intent/planner.py` (contains models, basic planner), `intent/enhanced_task_planner.py` (contains advanced execution logic), `orchestrator.py` (integrates planners), `ai/content_analyzer.py` (implemented), `workflows/manager.py` (implemented), `monitoring/background.py` (implemented), `execution/rollback.py` (enhanced version implemented). These seem largely implemented, although the *integration* of the advanced planner execution within the orchestrator needs confirmation.
    *   **Phase 6 Files:** `context/enhancer.py`, `context/file_resolver.py`, `context/file_activity.py`, `execution/hooks.py` all seem to be implemented based on the provided code. `ai/prompts.py` was updated.
    *   **Phase 7 Files:** `generation/engine.py`, `generation/planner.py`, `generation/architecture.py`, `generation/documentation.py`, `generation/frameworks.py`, `generation/validators.py`, `toolchain/git.py`, `toolchain/package_managers.py`, `toolchain/ci_cd.py`, `review/diff_manager.py`, `review/feedback.py`. These files exist and appear to contain significant implementation logic related to code generation, toolchain integration, and review/feedback loops. The core engine (`generation/engine.py`) seems to orchestrate project/feature generation.
*   **Impact:** Underdeveloped key files would mean core features described in the roadmap are non-functional.
*   **Suggested Solution:** While the files exist and have code, deeper testing (Manual and Automated, as requested in `NextSteps.md`) is required to verify the *correctness* and *completeness* of these implementations, especially for the complex interactions in Phases 5-7. Focus testing on the integration points and the execution flow for multi-step/generation tasks.
*   **Priority:** High (for testing and verification).

**8. Inter-Module Communication & Data Flow:**

*   **Issue Description:** Assessing how data is passed between modules.
*   **Location:** Primarily `orchestrator.py` and the functions/methods it calls.
*   **Findings:**
    *   **Context Dictionary:** The primary mechanism seems to be the `context` dictionary, which is built by `context_manager`, enhanced by `context_enhancer`, and passed around (e.g., to `_get_ai_suggestion`, `plan_task`). This is a common pattern.
    *   **Function Arguments/Return Values:** Standard Python function calls are used (e.g., `orchestrator` calls `adaptive_engine.execute_command`).
    *   **Registry:** Used effectively in `enhanced_planner_integration.py` and potentially elsewhere to get instances of services like `rollback_manager` without direct imports, breaking cycles.
    *   **Advanced Planner Data Flow:** The `enhanced_task_planner.py` introduces a more formal `StepExecutionContext` and `DataFlowVariable` system, using variable substitution (`${var}`) and result referencing (`${result.step_id.field}`). This is crucial for complex tasks but needs careful implementation and testing to ensure variables resolve correctly.
*   **Impact:** Unclear or inconsistent data flow makes the system hard to debug and extend. Errors in variable resolution in the advanced planner would break complex tasks.
*   **Suggested Solution:**
    *   Document the structure of the main `context` dictionary and ensure consistency in how modules access it.
    *   Thoroughly test the variable substitution and result referencing logic in the `EnhancedTaskPlanner`. Add specific tests for data flow between different step types (COMMAND, CODE, API, etc.).
    *   Ensure the `registry` is used consistently wherever circular dependencies might arise.
*   **Priority:** High (for testing advanced planner data flow), Medium (for context dictionary consistency).

**9. Configuration Management:**

*   **Issue Description:** How configuration (e.g., API keys) is loaded and accessed.
*   **Location:** `config.py`, `.env.example`, usage points.
*   **Findings:**
    *   `config.py` uses `python-dotenv` to load `.env` files and environment variables.
    *   It defines Pydantic models (`AppConfig`, `ApiConfig`, `UserConfig`) for structure and validation.
    *   It attempts to load from `~/.config/angela/config.toml` using `tomllib` (or `tomli`) and save using `tomli-w`.
    *   A global `config_manager` instance is created and loads config on import.
    *   Access seems consistent via `config_manager.config.api.gemini_api_key`.
    *   The TOML handling includes checks for library availability and error handling during load/save.
*   **Impact:** Incorrect configuration handling would prevent the application from starting or connecting to essential services like the Gemini API.
*   **Suggested Solution:** The current implementation looks robust and follows good practices. Ensure the `.env.example` clearly documents required variables. Test the loading precedence (environment vs. TOML file).
*   **Priority:** Low (seems well-implemented).

**10. Error Handling Strategy:**

*   **Issue Description:** Consistency and effectiveness of error handling.
*   **Location:** Throughout the codebase, especially in `orchestrator.py`, `execution/engine.py`, `ai/client.py`, `execution/error_recovery.py`.
*   **Findings:**
    *   `try...except` blocks are used in key areas like API calls (`ai/client.py`), command execution (`execution/engine.py`), file operations (`execution/filesystem.py`), and request processing (`orchestrator.py`).
    *   Logging (`logger.error`, `logger.exception`) is used within except blocks, which is good.
    *   Specific custom exceptions like `FileSystemError` are defined and used.
    *   The `execution/error_recovery.py` module provides a dedicated mechanism for handling errors during *multi-step plan execution*, including strategies like RETRY, MODIFY_COMMAND, etc. This is a sophisticated approach.
    *   The `ai/analyzer.py` provides analysis and fix suggestions for *command execution errors*.
    *   **Inconsistency:** It's not immediately clear if *all* potential failure points consistently use the logging framework or if some might print directly to stderr or raise unhandled exceptions. The integration of `ErrorRecoveryManager` seems tied specifically to the enhanced planner's execution loop â€“ how are errors handled in simpler command executions or other parts of the system?
*   **Impact:** Inconsistent error handling makes debugging difficult and can lead to unexpected crashes or silent failures. Lack of recovery mechanisms reduces robustness.
*   **Suggested Solution:**
    *   Establish a clear, documented error handling policy:
        *   When to log vs. raise exceptions.
        *   Use specific custom exceptions where appropriate.
        *   How errors should propagate back to the `orchestrator` and then to the user via the `formatter`.
    *   Ensure the `ErrorRecoveryManager` is invoked appropriately during *any* multi-step process, not just those explicitly using the advanced planner's execution loop (if there's a distinction).
    *   Review major components (`ai`, `execution`, `generation`, etc.) to ensure consistent use of `try...except` and logging for anticipated errors (e.g., network issues, file not found, permission errors).
*   **Priority:** Medium to High.

**11. Missing Features (Based on Goals):**

*   **Issue Description:** Features implied by the ambitious goals but potentially underdeveloped.
*   **Location:** N/A (Conceptual).
*   **Findings:**
    *   **True AGI/Deep Shell Integration:** While the structure is good, achieving the "ambient," "frictionless" integration described requires deep shell modification or wrapping, which is complex and not fully evident in the Python code alone (depends heavily on `angela.bash`/`angela.zsh` hooks and potentially lower-level system interaction). The current Python code focuses on processing commands *after* they are explicitly sent to `angela`.
    *   **Massive Code Generation Orchestration:** The `generation/` module exists, but generating *entire websites* autonomously requires very sophisticated planning, state management, inter-file dependency handling, and potentially multiple chained LLM calls. The current `generation/engine.py` and `planner.py` provide a foundation, but the logic to handle truly massive, multi-file generation might need significant expansion and testing.
    *   **Autonomous CI/CD:** `toolchain/ci_cd.py` exists, but generating *and executing* CI/CD pipelines autonomously involves interacting with potentially complex external systems or local tools (Docker, Jenkins, cloud CLIs) and requires robust state tracking and error handling far beyond just generating config files.
    *   **Profound Contextual Awareness:** Phase 6 laid the groundwork, but true "profound" awareness (inferring project *types* accurately, understanding semantic relationships between files, remembering fine-grained user actions across sessions) requires ongoing refinement and potentially more sophisticated context models than currently shown.
    *   **Universal CLI Tool Translation:** Translating natural language to *any* CLI tool (Docker, gcloud, kubectl, etc.) requires either extensive specific training/prompting for the LLM or a complex internal mapping/adapter system.
*   **Impact:** The codebase provides the building blocks, but achieving the most ambitious "AGI-in-the-terminal" goals will require significant further development and refinement, particularly in planning, state management, and LLM interaction strategies for complex tasks.
*   **Suggested Solution:**
    *   Acknowledge that these are stretch goals. Focus on solidifying the existing phases first.
    *   For massive code-gen/CI/CD: Break down the process. Start with generating smaller, well-defined components. Implement robust state tracking for multi-step generation. Develop strategies for handling LLM token limits (e.g., summarizing context, generating file-by-file).
    *   For deeper integration: Investigate advanced shell integration techniques (e.g., `PROMPT_COMMAND` in Bash, `preexec`/`precmd` in Zsh, potentially wrapping the shell process).
    *   For universal tool translation: Start with a few key tools (Git, Docker) and build specific adapters/prompts for them before attempting a generic solution.
*   **Priority:** High (for managing expectations and planning future work).

---

**General Observations & Recommendations:**

1.  **Testing is Crucial:** As you noted, manual and automated testing is paramount, especially for the complex interactions planned in Phases 5-7. Focus on integration tests that simulate real user requests and verify the end-to-end flow through the orchestrator, planners, execution engines, and safety checks. Test the data flow in the advanced planner rigorously.
2.  **Modularity:** The project benefits greatly from its modular structure. Continue to enforce clear boundaries and responsibilities between modules. Use the `registry` or dependency injection to manage dependencies cleanly.
3.  **Configuration:** The TOML/dotenv configuration is well-implemented. Ensure all configurable parameters (API keys, timeouts, feature flags) are managed through this system.
4.  **Documentation:** Add internal code documentation (docstrings) explaining the purpose of complex classes and functions, especially in the `orchestrator`, `planner`, `engine`, and `context` modules. Update the external `MD/` documentation to accurately reflect the *current* state and capabilities after each phase.
5.  **Enhanced Planner Integration:** Double-check that the `Orchestrator` is *always* using the `EnhancedTaskPlanner`'s execution logic (`execute_advanced_plan`) for multi-step tasks, as this seems to contain the more robust error handling and data flow mechanisms. The patching mechanism in `enhanced_planner_integration.py` needs to be reliable.
6.  **Async Usage:** The use of `asyncio` is appropriate for I/O-bound tasks like API calls and potentially command execution. Ensure it's used consistently where beneficial and that blocking calls don't stall the event loop unnecessarily.

**Conclusion:**

The Angela-CLI codebase represents a strong foundation for a very ambitious project. The modular design is sound, and many core components seem well-implemented based on the provided snippets. The primary areas needing attention are:

1.  **Integration & Orchestration:** Ensuring all components are correctly wired together, especially for the advanced planning and execution flows.
2.  **Completeness & Robustness:** Verifying that the implementations match the roadmap's intent and handle errors gracefully, particularly for complex, multi-step tasks and code generation.
3.  **Testing:** Implementing a thorough testing strategy to validate the complex interactions between modules.
4.  **Clarity:** Refining the roles of potentially overlapping modules (like the planners).

Addressing these points will significantly strengthen the codebase and pave the way for successfully implementing the remaining advanced features.
