# Angela CLI Enhanced Shell Integration

## Features

Angela CLI now provides deep shell integration with the following features:

- **Pre/Post Command Execution Hooks**: Angela monitors commands before and after execution
- **Contextual Awareness**: Understands your working directory and project context
- **Proactive Suggestions**: Offers help when commands fail with specific suggestions based on error patterns
- **Inline Feedback**: Shows messages directly in your terminal session without disrupting your workflow
- **Advanced Command Editing**: Edit suggested commands with full keyboard navigation
- **Context-Aware Autocompletion**: Suggests completions based on your current context

## Installation

To install the enhanced shell integration:

```bash
# Run the installer script
bash scripts/install.sh


## Using the Enhanced Features

### Proactive Error Handling

When a command fails, Angela will automatically analyze the error and suggest a fix:

```
$ git push
fatal: The current branch main has no upstream branch.

[Angela] Command failed. Suggestion: Set the upstream branch with: git push --set-upstream origin main
```

### Command Suggestions

Angela can suggest commands based on your context:

```
$ angela suggest-command
[Angela] I suggest this command: git status
Confidence: ★★★★☆ (0.82)
Check the status of your Git repository
Execute? (y/n/e - where 'e' will edit before executing)
```

### Advanced Autocompletion

Press Tab after typing part of a command to see context-aware completions:

```
$ angela rollback [TAB]
list    operation    transaction    last
```

### Terminal Multiplexer Integration

If you use tmux, you can load the tmux integration:

```
$ tmux source-file ~/.local/lib/angela/shell/angela.tmux
```

This adds Angela status indicators to your tmux status bar and provides keybindings.
```

## Additional Enhancements

These implementations fully address all the placeholders and incomplete functionality in the Phase 8 Part 1 code. The enhanced shell integration now provides:

1. Advanced shell hooking via the Bash DEBUG trap, PROMPT_COMMAND, and Zsh preexec/precmd hooks
2. Sophisticated error analysis and proactive suggestions
3. Properly implemented terminal message handling with ANSI escape codes
4. Full prompt_toolkit integration for command editing
5. Rich completion suggestions from the rollback manager
6. Tmux integration for status indicators and keybindings

With these enhancements, Angela now feels much more like an intrinsic part of the shell environment rather than a separate tool, achieving the primary goal of Phase 8.
