# Phase 6 added
Phase 6 added the following capabilities to Angela CLI:

1. **Project Type Inference** - Automatically detect project type, frameworks, and dependencies
2. **File Reference Resolution** - Resolve file references from natural language
3. **File Activity Tracking** - Track file operations for better context
4. **Enhanced Prompt Engineering** - Use all the above to improve AI responses
----------

## AFter phase 6 we need to still ensure that --

Execution Tracking Integration
To ensure proper file activity tracking, the execution hooks need to be integrated into:

Command execution in adaptive_engine.py
File operations in filesystem.py

---------

Next Steps
With Phase 6 complete, Angela CLI will have significantly enhanced context awareness, allowing it to provide more relevant and accurate assistance. This sets the stage for the next phases which could include:

Learning from Context: Using accumulated context to learn user preferences
Predictive Assistance: Suggesting common operations based on file activity
Advanced Project Analysis: Deep understanding of project architecture and dependencies

The foundation you've built with Phase 6 provides the contextual intelligence needed for these more advanced capabilities.


### Step 7: Developer Tool Integration (MAIN ASPECTY OF THIS WHOLE THING WERE IT COMES ALL TOGETHOR)
Key Objectives for Phase 7:
Advanced Code Generation Engine: Develop a sophisticated module capable of generating entire directory structures and multiple code files based on high-level natural language descriptions (e.g., "Create a Python Flask backend for a to-do list app with user authentication and a PostgreSQL database").
Multi-File Project Planning & Orchestration: Enable the AI to plan the structure of a new project, identify necessary files, their roles, and interdependencies, and then orchestrate their generation.
Deep Developer Toolchain Integration (Initial):
Git: Beyond simple commands, integrate Git into the code generation lifecycle (e.g., auto-commit initial project scaffolding, create feature branches for new modules).
Build/Package Managers: Detect and interact with common build tools (e.g., pip for Python, npm for Node.js) to install dependencies required by generated code.
Test Frameworks (Basic): Generate boilerplate test files (e.g., pytest, unittest) alongside functional code.
Interactive Code Review & Refinement Loop: Implement mechanisms for users to review generated code (potentially large diffs across multiple files) and provide feedback for iterative refinement by Angela.
Contextual Large-Scale Code Manipulation: Extend file content understanding (from Phase 5) to support complex, multi-file refactoring or feature addition based on natural language requests (e.g., "Add an endpoint to the user service to update email addresses").
Initial CI/CD Workflow Automation (Local): Enable Angela to execute sequences of local build, test, and commit operations, forming the basis for more complex CI/CD pipeline interactions later. Generate basic CI configuration files (e.g., .gitlab-ci.yml, Jenkinsfile, GitHub Actions workflow).
Enhanced Prompt Engineering for Code Architecture: Develop new prompt strategies specifically for architecting and generating complex codebases, managing "massive context" by breaking down tasks and feeding relevant information to the Gemini API strategically.




Challenges & Considerations for Phase 7:
LLM Reliability for Complex Code: Generating syntactically correct and logically sound code across multiple files is hard. Expect iterative refinement to be essential.
Token Limits: "Massive context" requires smart chunking, summarization, and passing of relevant context between LLM calls.
State Management: Keeping track of the state of a multi-file generation process is complex.
Idempotency: Re-running a generation command should ideally produce the same result or allow safe updates.
Security: Generating code that interacts with build tools or system commands requires careful sandboxing or very clear user confirmation for execution steps.
User Experience: Presenting large amounts of generated code for review needs a good UI/UX within the CLI. Diffs are crucial.

## TESTING
### So i implememnehdt phases 1-7 for my angela-cli, we still have a long way to go, however I need to test all of it
### So give me in depth step by step instructions on how ot effectivly and effiently test it manuaully and automatically, more so manually because sometimes automatic testing (e.g test files) have issues with the actual test file itself and can throw me off.
### so give me step by step please  on how to test manually and maybe  overall automatically test that deosnt rely too much on the actual test file being correct/working, I dont wanna spend my time debugging a test file rather than the actual code.
