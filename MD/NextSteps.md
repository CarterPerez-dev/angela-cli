Execution Tracking Integration
To ensure proper file activity tracking, the execution hooks need to be integrated into:

Command execution in adaptive_engine.py
File operations in filesystem.py

Testing the Integration
After implementing all components, test the system with real-world scenarios:

Navigate to a Python project directory and run angela files project to verify project detection
Try file references like angela "analyze the main file"
Track file access with angela files recent
Test file resolution with angela files resolve "config"

Performance Considerations
Some of these features might add overhead to request processing. To maintain responsiveness:

Initialize project inference asynchronously during startup
Cache project information to avoid repeated inference
Use background tasks for non-critical file activity tracking

Next Steps
With Phase 6 complete, Angela CLI will have significantly enhanced context awareness, allowing it to provide more relevant and accurate assistance. This sets the stage for the next phases which could include:

Learning from Context: Using accumulated context to learn user preferences
Predictive Assistance: Suggesting common operations based on file activity
Advanced Project Analysis: Deep understanding of project architecture and dependencies

The foundation you've built with Phase 6 provides the contextual intelligence needed for these more advanced capabilities.


### Step 7: Developer Tool Integration (MAIN ASPECTY OF THIS WHOLE THING WERE IT COMES ALL TOGETHOR)
1. Add Git commands integration
2. Implement Docker support
3. Create code generation flow. it shoudl be able to create 8000 word code files, or small websites/apps etc etc. its essntially a code agent capapbale of great coding stregths. if teh user sasy "create me a porfolio website" it shoud be able to udnertand that and go ahead and create a whole directory/tree structure with files and even code those files in full and have it fully ready for developement.
4. Build multi-step workflow execution
5. Perform final testing, optimization, and documentation, containeriziation and even CI/CD if needed






## TESTING
### So i implememnehdt phases 1-7 for my angela-cli, we still have a long way to go, however I need to test all of it
### So give me in depth step by step instructions on how ot effectivly and effiently test it manuaully and automatically, more so manually because sometimes automatic testing (e.g test files) have issues with the actual test file itself and can throw me off.
### so give me step by step please  on how to test manually and maybe  overall automatically test that deosnt rely too much on the actual test file being correct/working, I dont wanna spend my time debugging a test file rather than the actual code.
