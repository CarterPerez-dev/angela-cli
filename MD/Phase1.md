# What we did

## Directory Structure Setup

Created the basic project structure:

```bash
mkdir -p angela-cli/angela/{__pycache__,shell,ai,context,intent,execution,safety,utils}
mkdir -p angela-cli/{scripts,shell,tests}
```

## Core Files Implementation

Started by implementing the essential files for Milestone 1A:

created the main package files:

created the logging utility:

implemented the utility initialization file:

implemented the utilities for project context awareness:

created the main CLI entry point and orchestrator:

created the shell integration scripts:

created the installation scripts:

created the Phase1 README file:

created sample .env.example file:

created a basic test file to start the test infrastructure:

## Angela-CLI: Phase 1 Implementation Summary

implemented the foundation for the Angela-CLI project, focusing on Phase 1 (Foundation & Shell Integration) as specified in the roadmap. Let me walk you through what has been accomplished:

### Core Setup (Milestone 1A)

1. **Project Structure**: Created the complete directory structure following the blueprint in Start.md.

2. **Configuration Management**: 
   - Implemented a robust configuration system that loads settings from both environment variables and config files
   - Added support for API keys and user preferences
   - Created initialization workflow

3. **Basic CLI Structure**:
   - Set up a command-line interface using Typer
   - Added version information, debug mode, and help text
   - Implemented the basic command flow

4. **Shell Hook Mechanism**:
   - Created Bash and Zsh integration scripts
   - Implemented installation/uninstallation scripts

5. **Simple Request Echo Pipeline**:
   - Created the orchestrator that connects all components
   - Implemented basic request handling and response formatting

### Context & Pipeline (Milestone 1B)

1. **Working Directory Tracking**:
   - Added current directory tracking in the context manager
   - Implemented context refreshing

2. **Project Root Detection**:
   - Created detection for common project markers (.git, package.json, etc.)
   - Added project type inference based on markers

3. **Logging Framework**:
   - Set up comprehensive logging with Loguru
   - Added file and console logging with rotation
   - Implemented debug mode configuration

4. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Created initial test framework with pytest
   - Added fixtures for common test scenarios
   - Implemented context manager tests

### What's Been Created

1. **Core Package Files**:
   - `__init__.py`, `__main__.py`: Entry points
   - `cli.py`: Command-line interface
   - `config.py`: Configuration management
   - `constants.py`: Global constants
   - `orchestrator.py`: Main request processing

2. **Context Management**:
   - `context/manager.py`: Tracks directory and project context

3. **Utility Functions**:
   - `utils/logging.py`: Logging configuration

4. **Shell Integration**:
   - `shell/angela.bash`: Bash integration
   - `shell/angela.zsh`: Zsh integration

5. **Installation Scripts**:
   - `scripts/install.sh`: Installation script
   - `scripts/uninstall.sh`: Uninstallation script

6. **Project Configuration**:
   - `pyproject.toml`: Project metadata
   - `requirements.txt`: Dependencies
   - `Makefile`: Build automation
   - `README.md`: Documentation

7. **Testing**:
   - `tests/conftest.py`: Test fixtures
   - `tests/test_context.py`: Context manager tests

### Next Steps

The implementation is ready for testing. Here's how to get started:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `make dev-setup` to set up the development environment
3. Run `make install` to install Angela CLI
4. Test the basic functionality with `angela hello world`

For Phase 2, we'll focus on:
1. Implementing the AI service with Google Gemini API
2. Building the intent parsing and action planning framework
3. Adding support for read-only information commands

This implementation provides a solid foundation that can be extended incrementally according to the roadmap. Each component is designed to be modular and testable, following best practices for Python development.
