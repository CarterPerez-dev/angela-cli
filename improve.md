## Enhance the confidence file to be more robust
---
## Imporve handling of Main.py and users input request (liek the actual text/syntax)
---
## VAstly imporve teh process request so each request adn cant delicated perfectly to each fucntion, aslo imporve the porcess command----- this needs imporvemnt code_generation_engine.create_project_files

# NOTES FOR ORCHESTRATOR
async def _process_command_request(self, request: str, context: Dict[str, Any], execute: bool, dry_run: bool) -> Dict[str, Any
async def _process_command_request(self, request: str, context: Dict[str, Any], execute: bool, dry_run: bool) -> Dict[str, Any]
Purpose: To handle requests that are likely to result in a single shell command.
Job:
Analyzes the intent using intent_analyzer.
Checks command history for similar past requests using history_manager.
Calls self._get_ai_suggestion() to get a command, explanation, etc., from the LLM.
Scores the confidence of the suggestion using confidence_scorer.
If confidence is low and not a dry run, it might ask the user for clarification/confirmation before proceeding.
If execute is true or dry_run is true, it uses the adaptive_engine to execute (or simulate) the command. The adaptive engine handles safety checks and its own confirmation prompts.
If execution fails, it uses error_analyzer to diagnose the error and suggest fixes.
May trigger background monitoring for failed commands.
Scenario: User types angela request "list files sorted by size".
Orchestrator determines RequestType.COMMAND.
This function gets an AI suggestion like ls -lahS.
Confidence is scored.
adaptive_engine executes ls -lahS.
The output, command, explanation, etc., are packaged and returned.
---------
async def _process_multi_step_request(self, request: str, context: Dict[str, Any], execute: bool, dry_run: bool) -> Dict[str, Any]
Purpose: To handle requests that require a sequence of operations or more complex logic than a single command. This version is specifically designed to integrate with the EnhancedTaskPlanner and ComplexWorkflowPlanner for advanced plan execution with rollback.
Determines the complexity of the request (simple vs. advanced) using task_planner._determine_complexity().

Calls self._handle_advanced_plan_execution() (a method patched in by enhanced_planner_integration.py) to display and execute this advanced plan. This execution will involve the EnhancedTaskPlanner's logic for handling various step types (COMMAND, CODE, API, LOOP, DECISION).
-----------
Starts a rollback transaction if execute is true and not dry_run, as manipulations are involved.
Uses self._extract_file_path() (which uses file_resolver) to identify the target file from the request.
Calls self._determine_file_operation_type() to figure out if the user wants to "analyze", "summarize", "search", or "manipulate" the file.
Delegates to the appropriate method in ai/content_analyzer.py:
##
Delegates to the appropriate method in ai/content_analyzer.py:
content_analyzer.analyze_content()
content_analyzer.summarize_content()
content_analyzer.search_content()
content_analyzer.manipulate_content()
For "manipulate":
If execute and not dry_run, it gets confirmation for the changes (showing a diff).
If confirmed, it records the content manipulation for rollback (original content/diff) using rollback_manager.
Writes the modified content to the file.
Scenario: User: angela request "in my_script.py, change all 'foo' to 'bar'"
Orchestrator determines RequestType.FILE_CONTENT.
This function identifies my_script.py and operation type "manipulate".
content_analyzer.manipulate_content() gets the original content, asks AI to change "foo" to "bar", and returns the original, modified content, and a diff.
The user is shown the diff and asked to confirm.
If confirmed, the change is written to my_script.py, and the original content/diff is logged for rollback







break this down for me and what uses get ai suggestiuons async def _get_ai_suggestion(self, request: str, context: Dict[str, Any], similar_command: Optional[str] = None, intent_result: Optional[Any] = None) -> CommandSuggestion
Purpose: A helper method to encapsulate the logic of getting a command suggestion from the AI.
Job:
Calls build_prompt (from ai/prompts.py) to construct the prompt, including the user's request, current context, any similar past command, and the result of intent analysis.
Sends this prompt to the GeminiClient.
Parses the AI's JSON response into a CommandSuggestion object using parse_ai_response.
Scenario: This is called by _process_command_request and potentially other methods when they need the AI to translate natural language into a shell command.


async def _monitor_for_suggestions(self, command: str, error_analysis: Dict[str, Any]) -> None
Purpose: The actual background task that might offer suggestions after a command failure.
Job: Waits a couple of seconds (to let the user see the initial error). Then, if it has fix suggestions from the error_analysis, it prints the top few to the console, along with instructions on how to try them using Angela (e.g., "angela try fix 1").






# IMPORTANT
async def _process_code_generation_request(...), async def _process_feature_addition_request(...), async def _process_toolchain_operation(...), async def _process_code_refinement_request(...), async def _process_code_architecture_request(...), async def _process_universal_cli_request(...), async def _process_complex_workflow_request(...), async def _process_ci_cd_pipeline_request(...), async def _process_proactive_suggestion(...)
Purpose: These are specific handlers for the newer, more advanced RequestTypes.
Job: Each of these methods will:
Log that they are processing their specific type of request.
Delegate the core logic to the appropriate specialized module:
CODE_GENERATION & FEATURE_ADDITION -> generation/engine.py (code_generation_engine)
TOOLCHAIN_OPERATION -> Specific modules in toolchain/ (like docker.py, ci_cd.py, git.py) or UniversalCLITranslator.
CODE_REFINEMENT -> review/feedback.py (feedback_manager)
CODE_ARCHITECTURE -> generation/architecture.py (architectural_analyzer)
UNIVERSAL_CLI -> toolchain/universal_cli.py (or enhanced_universal_cli.py)
COMPLEX_WORKFLOW & CI_CD_PIPELINE -> intent/complex_workflow_planner.py and toolchain/ modules, often coordinated by integrations/phase12_integration.py.
PROACTIVE_SUGGESTION -> Likely interacts with monitoring/proactive_assistant.py to present or act on a suggestion.
Handle the execute and dry_run flags appropriately for their operation.
Package the results from the specialized module into a consistent dictionary format.
Scenario (Code Generation): User: angela generate create-project "python web app".
Orchestrator determines RequestType.CODE_GENERATION.
_process_code_generation_request is called.
It calls code_generation_engine.generate_project(...) to get a CodeProject plan.
If execute is true, it calls code_generation_engine.create_project_files(...) to write the files.

### fix or imporve error recovery
If execution fails and not a dry run, it attempts error recovery using self._handle_execution_errors().
