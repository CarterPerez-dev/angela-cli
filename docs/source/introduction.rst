What is Angela CLI?
------------------

Angela CLI is an AI-powered command-line assistant that integrates deeply with your terminal shell.
It's designed to understand natural language requests and convert them into appropriate shell commands,
file operations, or multi-step workflows.

Unlike traditional command-line tools, Angela CLI provides:

* **Natural language understanding**: Ask for what you want in plain English
* **Context awareness**: Angela understands your project structure and environment
* **Safety mechanisms**: Automated backups and risk assessment before executing commands
* **Multi-step workflows**: Break complex tasks into manageable steps
* **Tool integration**: Seamless interaction with Git, Docker, and other development tools

Philosophy
---------

Angela CLI is built with the following principles in mind:

1. **Minimize friction**: The ideal CLI assistant should feel like a natural extension of your shell
2. **Maximize context**: Use available information to make better decisions
3. **Prioritize safety**: Never execute high-risk operations without explicit confirmation
4. **Embrace customization**: Adapt to your workflow and preferences over time
5. **Be transparent**: Always be clear about what actions are being taken

Angela CLI is not designed to replace your existing command-line skills but to augment them,
making you more productive and reducing the cognitive load of remembering complex command syntax.
